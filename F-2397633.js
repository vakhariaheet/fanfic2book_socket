</strong><p></p><p>Narcissa
Malfoy briefly double-checked the appearance of her four companions.
Cavanaugh, Macnair, Pettigrew, and her lovely husband Lucius had to
resemble filthy muggles. And for some reason, she got the lucky
privilege of being the spokesperson. But they were desperate to find
out what happened to their Master three days ago. Something big
happened on Halloween. The rumor the papers were reporting as truth
was that a baby reflected the Dark Lord's Killing Curse back on
him. And they all thought the Dark Lord was dead. But anyone with a
mark on their arm can tell their Master is not gone. It's
different. It's definitely weaker. But it is still there.</p><p>And
so it was that on the early evening of November 3rd the
five Death Eaters knocked on the door of Number Four Privet Drive.</p><p>A
horse-faced woman who had a vague passing resemblance to the mudblood
Lily Potter, n√©e Evans answered the door. "Are you the babysitter?"</p><p>Narcissa
paused and looked at the others with a pleading look in her eyes.
"Umm, yes. I am." She explained. "I mean we all are. These are
my friends who assist me on occasion."</p><p>A
beefy gruff looking man came towards the door pushing a stroller with
the pudgiest sack of baby anyone had ever seen.</p><p>Narcissa
smiled weakly. "Oh, is this little guy him?"</p><p>The
beefy man shook his head and his cheeks sounded a bit like a horse
with the wobbling they were doing. "Oh no. This little angel is our
Dudley."</p><p>The
horse-faced woman added, "Dudders is coming with us."</p><p>The
beefy man looked at Narcissa and explained, "The freak is in the
cupboard under the stairs. Won't shut up."</p><p>The
horse-faced woman continued. "We've even fed it and changed its
newspaper. Still won't stop crying."</p><p>"Anyways,
we're off. Tally-ho." The beefy man apparently ended his part of
the discussion with this and walked past the odd collection of
babysitters pushing the gelatinous blob he called his son.</p><p>The
horse-faced woman walked past them as well and said, "We shouldn't
be more than a few hours. Just need a break from the abnormal freak
and its unnatural crying."</p><p>The
five Death Eaters just stood there on the front step in shock
watching the disgusting muggles get into their giant metal box. A
couple of them couldn't help but go for their wands when the box
roared like an acromantula in heat. Narcissa halted them and they
waited. Slightly amazed to see the metal box roll away on wheels the
muggles appeared to be able to exert some control over.</p><p>Cavanaugh
asked, "Do all muggles have their own Knight buses or something?"</p><p>Narcissa
shook her head. "Never mind now. Let's go see this
Boy-Who-Lived."</p><p>The
group made its way into the disgusting excuse for a home and closed
the front door behind them, making sure no one was watching.</p><p>Narcissa
went straight to the cupboard under the stairs where quiet sniffling
could be heard. When she opened the door and the light came into the
small cupboard, the young boy immediately stopped crying and looked
curiously at the appearance of colors again. Narcissa reached in and
pulled out the basket with the small quiet child.</p><p>"These
muggles are disgusting. The way they treat a wizard. Even if he's a
halfblood, he's still more wizard than they are." She said
shaking her head.</p><p>She
set the baby down on the coffee table the five Death Eaters were now
surrounding. He was a cute child, if a little on the small side. His
brilliantly green eyes stared at all of them in wonder. He was naked
and sitting in a pile of crumpled up newspaper. There was one
uncrumpled sheet of newspaper covering him.</p><p>Lucius
bent down to inspect this oddity of magic. "Is really that scar all
that the curse did to him?" He lifted the sheet of newspaper and
was looking at the fifteen month old's legs and feet. He moved his
eyes upwards towards his belly and chest.</p><p>Young
Harry decided this was an excellent opportunity to play and proceeded
to pee straight up in the air. Directly into Lucius' open mouth.</p><p>The
blonde man jerked up quickly and began spitting every bit of moisture
he could out of his mouth. He was pissed. "Why you little!"</p><p>He
yanked out his wand and cast a very dark and nearly unblockable
castration hex at the offending baby.</p><p>The
other Death Eaters were a bit shocked to see the deep red of the
curse wash over the young boy and recollect around the baby's
midsection before rocketing straight back at Lucius.</p><p>Lucius
was completely unprepared for this and took the spell head on. He
quickly doubled over and fell to the floor screaming and clutching
his own bloody crotch.</p><p>Narcissa
rolled her eyes and muttered, "Well I guess Draco is an only
child."</p><p>Peter
Pettigrew who never credits thinking quickly as one of his useful
assets snapped into action. He snarled in his rage and cast
"<em>Imperio</em>!" at the baby.</p><p>The
spell went straight into the young Potter and came shooting out his
eyes back at Pettigrew. Peter had time to flinch before his head
snapped back with the force of the spell. Peter brought his head back
forward and he had a maniacal grin on his face. He dropped his wand
and said "heh-heh-hehn yah-dah-yah," while clapping the base of
his palms together.</p><p>Little
Harry was immediately joining him in squealing with glee and clapping
his palms together as well. Peter was using his index finger now to
do some nasal cavity exploring and Harry loved every minute of it.</p><p>Narcissa
was beginning to take stock of the situation and wasn't sure what
to do. Her husband was blabbering a bit and apparently still
bleeding. And it appeared Pettigrew was under the influence of the
baby. "Cavanaugh, <em>Avada</em>s on the count of three. He won't be
able to block two at the same time. Ready?"</p><p>Cavanaugh
aimed his wand and was ready.</p><p>Narcissa
began, "One. Two. Three. <em>Avada Ke</em>-"</p><p>Cavanaugh
cast "<em>Avada Kedavra</em>!" He felt awfully cheated as he realized
Narcissa had stopped her incantation and only one green light of
death was rushing to the baby. And now surrounding him in a bright
light. And now reflecting it straight back.</p><p>Narcissa
just said "Hmm," while the other Death Eater slumped to the floor
dead of another reflected Killing Curse.</p><p>"We
must try muggle means. Macnair, go grab a knife from the kitchen."
Narcissa ordered with a knowing look towards Macnair.</p><p>Peter
was now just nodding his head up and down and clapping once with each
movement.</p><p>Macnair
returned with an evil gleam in his eye and a sharp steak knife in his
hand. He stepped up to the smiling baby and moved his hand towards
him.</p><p>Baby
Harry saw something shiny and squealed again with glee. He was
clapping furiously and a shot of light flew from his clapping hands
and hit Macnair on the hand holding the knife.</p><p>Macnair
hissed and pulled back his now burning hand. They were all a bit
shocked to see the knife floating in the air, spinning slowly a foot
above the Boy-Who-Lived.</p><p>Harry
was now trying to reach up and grab the nice shiny pretty thing. It
was just a little bit too far out of his reach but he kept trying.</p><p>Macnair
saw what was happening and began to reach for it.</p><p>Harry
saw someone was going for his shiny toy and let out a loud gasp.</p><p>Right
as Macnair reached for it, Peter Pettigrew lunged forward and pushed
it a bit into Macnair's hand. Macnair flinched and whipped his hand
back. Unfortunately the knife was already slightly lodged into his
hand. Even more unfortunate was that it was only slightly lodged and
not fully lodged. Because when he whipped his hand back the knife
came flying out and rotated once through the air before becoming
embedded all the way to the hilt in Macnair's left eye.</p><p>Macnair
responded by squealing and flailing his hands around.</p><p>Harry
saw someone else playing his game and began squealing and clapping
too. Pettigrew joined Harry in his round of applause for the funny
man with a steak knife through his eye.</p><p>Narcissa
had seen enough. She was well aware of the fact that she was the only
one of the five still even capable at the moment.</p><p>The
beefy man walked back into his living room at this point muttering
about "Bastard maitre d's. Saying they wouldn't seat us with
Dudley. Who cares about the other customers' appetites?"</p><p>Narcissa
hit him with a stunner immediately. The horse-faced woman followed
her husband in and she was stunned before she even saw her husband on
the floor. Narcissa eyed the ugly crying flesh ball in the stroller
and stunned it twice just to be sure.</p><p>Harry
and Peter both gurgled and clapped.</p><p>Narcissa
looked over at the smiling gurgling baby and realized the potential
this child had. He was going to be a heck of a wizard someday. Maybe
even be proud to serve the Dark Lord. Maybe not. But knowing her
Draco was the only child Lucius was going to give her, she couldn't resist
a little maternal instinct.</p><p>She
cast a clotting charm on her husband and stunned him to shut him up.
Macnair kept touching the handle of the knife in his eye, and then
wincing and letting go. He whimpered and then would repeat this
process several times before Narcissa just stunned him too. She
stepped over the unconscious man and pulled the knife out. She said
"oops" when she realized his eyeball was still skewered on the
knife, and cast a clotting charm in his empty socket. She stunned
Pettigrew who had started putting as many fingers into his mouth as
he could.</p><p>She
then cleaned up the young baby and was smiling down on him. She put
him in a proper fresh cloth diaper she had conjured and took out the
newspaper, replacing it with soft pillows and warm blankets.</p><p>Harry
was getting tired from all the excitement and fell asleep in the warm
blankets.</p><p>Narcissa
cleaned up the messes they had made, and stuffed the speared eyeball
into Macnair's pocket. She walked over to the two filthy muggles and
<em>ennervated</em> them.</p><p>"<em>Obliviate</em>,"
Narcissa cast. "You will treat Harry fairly. You will care for him
like a proper Aunt and Uncle should for an orphaned child. You will
love him and raise him well. You will help him to learn about the
magical world, and provide him with opportunities to be a part of
that world."</p><p>The
horse-faced woman and beefy man had a glazed over look in their eyes.
They were amiably nodding their heads to the memories Narcissa was
giving them.</p><p>The
filthy muggles picked up their still sleeping son, as well as their
sleeping nephew and carried them up to their own bedrooms.</p><p>Narcissa
gathered the stunned Macnair, Pettigrew, and Lucius, as well as the
dead Cavanaugh, and gripped onto all of them. She activated a portkey
to Malfoy Manor, and there was no sign that there had ever been Death
Eaters in Privet Drive.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="">Albus
Dumbledore was surprised to see Arabella Figg in his fireplace. Her
head was coming out his office's floo entrance. "Albus! I'm not
sure but I think I saw some lights that looked like spells over at
the Dursleys' place."
<p>Albus
jumped into action. "I'll check it out right now." He grabbed
one of his emergency portkeys to Privet Drive and appeared hidden by
the bushes to the side of the house. He quickly walked to the front
door and knocked.</p><p>Vernon
Dursley opened the door. "Can I help you?"</p><p>"Have
you by chance seen any wizards tonight?" Albus carefully asked.</p><p>Vernon
looked shocked for a moment, before smiling and nodding. "Oh you
must be one of them to have asked me that. Nope. Only one I've seen
is my nephew. Petunia was just putting the boys back to sleep."</p><p>Albus
asked, "Could I by chance check on Harry?" He saw the suspicion
on Mr. Dursley's face and began subtly sending out <em>Legilimens</em>
messages saying "Trust me."</p><p>Vernon
smiled. "Sure." He waved the funny looking old man in. "Come on
up."</p><p>Albus
arrived into Harry's room and saw he was sleeping contently in warm
blankets and he had a smile on his face. Petunia was hunched over
watching him sleep.</p><p>Albus
could immediately tell Harry was just fine and not under any spell.
But he recognized the slightly glassy look of a memory charm on the two adult
Dursleys. He knew what he had to do to protect young Harry.</p><p>"Could
you stand next to your wife, please?" Albus asked of Vernon. He was
sending out the feelings of trust again.</p><p>Vernon
walked over to her while Petunia just looked at him a bit curiously.</p><p>"<em>Obliviate</em>,"
Albus smiled. "Whatever future instructions or plans or behavior
alterations you have been given you are to ignore. You will treat
Harry the same way you always do. With all the love and care you feel
he deserves." Albus doubted they would appreciate having the
memories of dark wizards attacking them and simply overrode the
previous obliviation's suggestions. He realized he needed to add to
the wards here and he cast some more identifiers to know if anyone
else magical was in here.</p><p>Albus
thought aloud, "Ahh Harry. I know you'll never be able to
properly thank me for all that I do for you, but just knowing I could
do my part to give you a happy childhood brings warmth to my
heart."</p><p>Albus
felt a vibration in his pocket. He pulled out his Order of the
Phoenix medallion. "Frank Longbottom is buzzing me again? That's
like the third time in the last half hour. Probably still worried
about the Prophecy." Albus shook his head. "What would young
parents do without me?"</p><p><em><strong></strong></em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade=""><p></p><p><em><strong>Author's
