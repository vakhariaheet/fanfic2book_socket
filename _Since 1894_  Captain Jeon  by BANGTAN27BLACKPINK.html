classes on purpose.” \nTae stood silent. He was standing right in front of his history professor. He knew that one day, his teacher would know that he’s skipping classes.\nBut he didn’t know it was today.\n“Give me your report.”\n—\nTae gulped. For fucks sake — the reason why he skipped class today is he doesn’t have a report.\n“I-I’m sorry ma’am but I left my report in our house—“ \n“You left your report or you did not do it?”\nHe looked down his feet and fidgeted with his fingers. He feel so nervous.\n—\nHe heard her sigh. “You’re a diligent student Mr. Kim. But I didn’t know that you’re like this.”\nSilence reigned in the room. Taehyung felt so frozen because he doesn’t know what will happen next.\n“For that, I will give you a special assignment.”\n—\nTae cursed mentally. Of all the punishments, why an assignment? \n“I want you to make a research about what truly happened to Captain Jeon and why was he proclaimed our national hero. I’m giving you a month to give me your answer.”\nTae’s mouth went agape.\n—\n“Captain Jeon? B-But not even the historians knew what—“\n“That’s why I’m asking you to do a research about it.” Srsly? He can’t take this kind of punishment, its just too unfair.\n“But ma’am—“\n“If you only did your report then you wont have to do this. You can leave now.”\n—\nHe had no choice but to take it anymore. He took a bow before leaving the room.\nAs soon as he went out, he saw Jimin leaning on the side of the wall — probably listening. \n“Tae—“\n“You did this, didn’t you?”\nJimin went silent. “Tae I told you I wont let this one slide.”\n—\nTae let out a sarcastic chuckle. “Because of you I had another shitty assignment!” He cried. Some of the students are looking at them now.\n“Are you really my bestfriend?” Jimin felt so offended. His heart sank. “Excuse me? You’re questioning our friendship now? Just because—\n—\nof that? Tae I’m your bestfriend but I won’t tolerate your wrong doings. I want the best for you—!”\n“Best for me? Your just my friend Jimin, not my parent. You don’t have the right to decide for me.”\nAnd Tae left. Jimin felt a tear roll down his cheeks.\nIs he a bad friend?<br><br><br>\n"},{"title":"2","data":"\n                                <img

[ A MONTH LATER ] \nTae just finished eating lunch. Its 12 in the afternoon and all of the studs are on their break. \nIts been a month and he still hasn’t talked to Jimin. He still feel mad about him and he knows that its not right to talk to him for now.\nBut he misses him.—\nOf course, who wouldn’t miss him? They’re always together for almost 24/7. Probably partners in crime already. They’ve grown together and he’s really happy that Jimin is his best friend.\nHe sighed and shook his thoughts out. He needs to distract himself. Probably read smthn?\n—\nHe was on his way to the library when he saw Mrs. Min coming on his way.\nHe cursed under his breath. Oh fuck, he still haven’t done his report and he forgot that today is the deadline.\nWell by deadline — he’s really dead.\nHe slowly took a turn and pretened like he didnt —<br>—\nsee his teacher. But unfortunately, she called him out. “Mr. Kim! I’ve been looking for you actually.” Mrs. Min said and Tae took a sigh.\nWhat’s he gonna do now?\n“Why is that?” He took out a nervous laugh and scratched the back of his head.\n“U know why. I need your report.”—\nHe’s literally cursing mentally using 20483920 languages to try and summon a portal so he can get out of this.\n“Oh...about that...” he started. His thoughts we’re scattered and he doesn’t know how to say it.\n“I...I did not do it.” He looked down at his feet, afraid of ——\nseeing her reaction. But he heard a deep sigh. “I have no words for you Mr. Kim. I gave you all the chances to keep up but you still didn’t do it.”\nShe crossed her arms above her chest. \n“This is your last chance. If you don’t submit ur report within another month then ——\nI’m sorry but I’m reporting you to the principal’s office.” She left and Tae’s mouth went agape.\nPrincipal’s office? Oh god no — just no. Just because of that one subject he’ll get reported? He’s been trying to maintain a good record eversince highschool!\nHe sighed and ——\nran. He didn’t know where he was going but he just followed the tracks of his own foot. \nHe wanted to shout, cry and break anything that he sees. He feel so angry and sad at the same time.\nHistory is just an easy subject. But he really doesn’t have interest in it.—\nHe reached the rooftop. No one was there, but he could see evrything from up here.\nHis knees went weak and he stumbled on the floor. He feel so pressured about everything thats happening to him.\nIts his 4th year of college, he’s almost graduating but y is this all happening?—\n“I fucking wish I lived in the year where it happened so I wouldn’t have to do all this shit.” He cried out.\nTime passed and his tears were all dried up. It was just a moment of weakness maybe?\nHe didn’t noticed that it was already his Art class. He’s super late.—\nBut he felt so down and he can’t even run. \nHe went downstairs and he reached the 3rd floor. It felt so odd because it was so quiet.\nThe classroom doors were closed but even though theyre having classes, its not this quiet.\nHe just shrugged it off and continued walking.—\nHe finally reached his classroom. The door was closed and it looked different.\n“The door is not like this before...” he muttered while looking at the scratchy wooden door.\nHe opened the door but he found no one inside. Its just all double-decked beds and bags.—\nHe furrowed his brows. He probably entered the wrong room.\nBut no.\nThis is his classroom number. Its very clear and there’s no way the teacher would move classrooms without him knowing.\nAnd plus, why would there be beds and bags here? This is a school, not a cabin.—\nHe looked around but he saw no one. He felt nervous as it sound so quiet and he feels like he’s the only person here.\nHe explored his gaze and saw the signs engraved on the walls.\n“Why is there traditional hanguls here?” He asked himself. He’s never seen those before. Weird.—\nHe decided to take a walk in the hallway. There’s seriously no one in here. Its been some minutes and he still haven’t seen any students.\nHe’s starting to get scared. “I wish Jimin was here...” he was slightly tearing up. Jimin was always there for him whenever he feels lost.\n"},{"title":"4","data":"—\nAnd now, he misses him even more.\n“Ouch!” He bumped onto someone while walking. How dumb of him, he didn’t even see that person coming.\nHe looked at the person and saluted before bowing. It was a soldier. \n“I’m sorry sir!” He said and dared to leave, but only a few steps ——\nwe’re made when the soldier called him out. “Excuse me, who are you?” The soldier asked with an intriguing voice.\n“I’m a student here, sir.” He said and he saw the soldier took a hold of his gun in his pocket.\nHis heart started to beat faster. “Student? Do u have any ——\nbelievable excuse?” Tae looked so confused. \n“W-What? I’m a student here. What are you talking about?” He asked and the soldier took out his gun, and pointed it to him.\n“Don’t you dare move.” Tae raised both of his hands like he’s surrendering. He felt so stiff and nervous.—\nThe soldier took out his radio and spoke against it while his eyes were still watching Tae.\n“Hello, this is Private First Class Jung Jae In. I found a spy lurking in here.”\nTae’s eyes bawled. “What?! I’m not a spy—!” But he was shut when the soldier shook the gun.—\n“3rd floor, left hallway. He’s wearing weird clothes, Idk how to express it in words. Please send a back-up.”\nThe soldier took down his radio and held the gun with both hands. “Sir, I s-swear I’m not a spy I’m just student—“\n“Save ur excuses in the investigation room.”—\nTae’s jaw dropped. “Investigation room?! Are you for real?!” \nBut the soldier did not respond — instead, he slowly walked towards him with his gun still pointed to him.\n“W-Why are you coming close?!” Tae was literally panicking.—\nThe soldier was already close to him and Tae felt so scared. What in the world was happening? \nHe shut his eyes and cursed in his mind. Its not or never.\nHe quickly kicked the soldier on the stomach and he stumbled on the floor with a painful cry.\n“Yah! Stop right there!”—\nHe did not listen and continued to ran away as fast as he could. He almost even fell on the floor because of his fast phase and the shaking of his legs weren’t helping either.\nWhy is there suddenly a soldier here? And its even accusing him of being a spy? For real?—\nHe bumped onto another group of soldiers but he was too fast to react and he quickly escaped them.\n“That’s the spy! Inform the others now!” He overhead them and he knew that theyre running after him. \nHe was going down to the second floor and he felt like crying cuz ——\nhis legs we’re already sore. \nBut he shouldn’t stop running for now. He quickly went down the stairs to the 1st floor. And he’s actually skipping steps just to run faster.\nRight when he reached the first floor, another group of soldiers cornered him.\n“Hey! Stop running!”—\nThey we’re blocking the right hallway, so he instead took the left hallway. \nHe’s very lucky that they haven’t shot him until now. Oh god.\nHis legs we’re quivering and its actually almost falling. The shaking was too intense and he felt so tired.—\nHe turned to see his back and there were so many soldiers running after him. He was about to face the front again when he bumped onto someone.\n“Ah!” Both of them stumbled on the floor. But Tae was on top of that person.\nAnd he’s shocked abt who that person is.\nCaptain Jeon.\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/f294b0ae894b8ed1bb3497a7a554b847fab5d35c/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f75326e4f5a4658524545416544673d3d2d313130323433303331352e313639333336373137323463613963643335373632343738323231302e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"1920\" data-original-height=\"1920\" alt=\"Captain Jeon\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n"},{"title":"5","data":"—\nTae felt hands lifting him up, even though he knew he got caught, he’s still stunned by what he just saw.\n“Captain,” all of them saluted. “I found him on the 3rd floor. He looks like he’s spying on us.”\nBut Tae was caught off by that. “I told you I’m not a spy! WTF?”—\nBoth of his arms we’re held by two soldiers and he knew they won’t let him go. But he still tried to escape their grip.\n“Investigate him.” A cold tone was heard and it sent chills to Tae’s spine. He’s literally silenced since he can’t believe he just heard Captain Jeon’s ——\nvoice. But hold up, isn’t he dead already? \nHe still kept on trying to shrug off their grip but he failed, and he only gained tiredness. \nThey arrived in a room. It looks like an investigation area were there’s another room inside where the conversation would be recorded ——\nand probably be interrogated. He was sat on a wooden chair and they tied his hands on the back of the chair.\n“No, let go of me!” Tae cried and it kind of hurts because the grip of the rope was too tight.\n“I don’t know what’s going on but I’m telling you for the second ——\ntime that I am not a spy! Can you all atleast listen to me?!” But no one paid attention to him.\nHe was about to shout again when Captain Jeon entered the room. Tae felt intimidated and confused at the same time. Someone is probably playing a trick on him.\nHe stood right —— \nin front of Tae, and it did not help at all. “State your name.” He said.\nTae opened his mouth but he no words came out. His throat suddenly felt dry and he doesn’t know why.\n“W-Why would I tell you my name?!” Tae forced a word.—\nBut he was surprised when the Captain pointed his gun at him. “Who sent you here? Who’s your boss?”\nTae felt even more nervous to the point that he’s almost tearing up. “I’m not a spy! For goodness sake have you seen this face? Have you ever seen a spy this beautiful?”—\nHe blinked like he was trying to act cute. He thought that it might helped but he realized it wont.\nJungkook pulled the trigger and shot it on the wall behind Tae. \n“Ah!” Tae cried, he was trembling in fear. He didn’t even realized that he was already crying.—\n“We won’t hurt you if you’ll tell the truth.” He said and put the gun back in its place.\n“Who are you?” , “He’s my son.”\nTae’s eyes shot wide open when he heard that. An old man with a soldier uniform entered the room with an angry face.—\nAll of the soldiers saluted and bowed to him. \n“General Kim, I’m sorry but I didn’t know that he was your son.” Jungkook said and bowed to him. \n“Untie him.” The general ordered and they immediately untied Tae. “See? I told you I’m not a spy.” Tae stuck his tongue out.—\nAnd Jungkook gave him a glare which immediately shut him down. “Go back to your duties. Son, I’ll send you home for now. You must be tired,” \n“And you Captain Jeon, i’ll see you in my office. I need to talk to you about something important.” \nJungkook saluted, “Yes sir.”\n"},{"title":"6","data":"\n                                <img

Your father told me what happened, are you okay?”\nA woman came running to Tae. She looks beautiful and she’s probably in her 40s. \nTae’s heart was beating faster. This feeling seems familiar, it’s just too familiar for him to forget. \n“M-Mom...?”—\nThe woman smiled and caressed his cheeks. “Are you hungry? Come here, I’ll cook you some food.”\nBut Tae didn’t follow. Instead, he was standing frozen with his tears flowing down. “Mom.” He muttered.\nHis mother died after giving birth to his brother. And after that, ——\nhe’s never experienced a mother’s love anymore. \nAnd now, right in front of him — his mother. The woman who gave him life and loved him with no condition. He missed her. He missed his mom.\nHe slowly sat on the chair table and stared at his mom. He can’t believe it.—\nIf this is a dream, he’d rather not wake up. “What’s wrong son?” She noticed him crying, and Tae just laughed it off. \n“It’s nothing mom, I...I just missed you.” His mom laughed. “Why are you suddenly acting strange?” She said.\nThe food was ready, and they chit chatted a ——\nlittle bit. “Mom, why are you wearing a traditional hanbok? I don’t remember any holidays today.” He said and his mother frowned.\n“What are you talking about? This is our clothes. And what are you wearing? I’ve never seen clothes like that before.” She said and it made ——\nTae confused as hell. “What? I don’t get you mom.” He chuckled nervously.\n“And what is this?” His mom pointed at his cellphone. “For real mom? You don’t know this?” His mom slowly shook her head.\nTae sighed. “This is called a cellphone. You use it to communicate, also for ——\nentertainments and checking dates.” He explained, its not brief but he knew she understood.\n“Really? Where did you get that? And can you tell me the date today?”\nTae checked his phone and went to the calendars. But he wasn’t expecting abt what he saw.\n“October 7, 1894.”\n\n                                <img

There we're lots of them, but enough to fit in the long elegant table. They're still not complete tho.\nTae was looking down from his room upstairs. His mother told him to dress up since they're also attending the ----\nmeeting. The house was elegant and you can really tell that the family is a bit fortunate in life just by looking at the interiors. \nIts a mansion but it looks more of like a palace. Tae hasn't explored it yet, because he thought that he might get lost at the size of it.\n\n      <img

They we're talking about everything that Tae couldn't understand, but he have his ears out.\nHe was just quietly eating his meal and kept on thinking about the things that happened today. \n\"This is my son, Kim Taehyung.\" he was out of his ----\nthoughts when his dad mentioned him. All of the eyes we're on him now. He used to like this kind of attention, but now that he's unfamiliar of what's happening -- he felt so uncomfortable.\n\"Haha, yow what's up.\" He greeted out of nervousness. He gulped when his dad raised ----\nan eyebrow at him. He also noticed the confusion in the visitor's face. \n\"What language is that Mr. Kim?\" One of the visitors asked. \"I haven't heard of that language.\" He gulped. How will he explain that it's english but in an advanced version?\n\"I-It's...uhm....\"--\nHis eyes started exploring the place. He's trying to look for some ideas. But his mind was faster to think.\n\"It's pornessian parappio language.\" he said and forced a smile. He laughed nervously when the visitors seemed convinced and amazed.\n\"You must be knowledgeable ----\nknowing this kind of language. I've been learning foreign languages but I haven't heard of this one. Maybe teach me some, someday?\" the visitor said and all of them laughed.\nMeanwhile, Taehyung had finally took a breath. He forgot that everything is formal here.\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/f5787db588c845402487be9fbab869553b51283c/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f3843557831384f7568346b4536413d3d2d313130323433373134392e3136393333373637353733333630303936373533363036303734342e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\" He forgot that everything is formal here\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/f3f2b862305feab2585ebf16efe2af95aeaec6ef/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f36553172316871787368584137413d3d2d313130323433373134392e313639333337363763646635613663663630323930333739323131332e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\"48\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n<br>48.\nThe dinner meeting was finished and his dad was still having a more private meeting with the visitors. \nMost of them we're high ranked officials. Some of them we're probably mentioned in their lessons but since Tae doesn't listen to history, he don't know them.--\nTae decided to explore the house. The servants we're cleaning the dining area and also cleaning the dishes. \nHe first started to go to the garden. As usual, there we're lots of plants and flowers. People liked to plant back then since it was their only entertainment.--\nHis next was the upstairs. There are lots of rooms. \"I wonder if I have a sibling here.\" he muttered to himself while caressing the stair fence.\nHe checked of the rooms but one of them was locked. Even though his curiosity was overflowing, he didn't get to open that room.--\n\"Why is that door locked?\" he asked himself. he went downstairs and the library caught his attention quickly. He entered the room and he was amazed about the amount of books that was stored.\nThe shelfs we're tall and they're all over the place. \"This is amazing.\" he said.--\nHe traced the books with his fingers. It wasn't dusty so that just means it is being read often. \n\"Oh my god!\" He cried when he saw a book that is all about fashion. He's a fanatic of fashion and designs. That's why he wanted to be a fashion designer.\nBut as soon as he ----\ntried to take it out, he heard a not so loud but intriguing noise. It seemed like something was opened. He quickly took another tour of the place and he found out that there's a secret room behind the shelfs.\nOut of curiosity, he immediately entered that room. It was ----\nbarely lit but the lights we're enough to light up the place. \nThere we're a lot of routes inside. There are also books, and some paintings inside it. It looks like a maze honestly. And he felt so different about it.\nHe continued to go further and further until he ----\nrealized that he was lost. \"Oh shit, where do I go?\" he asked himself while staring at the two routes -- left or right?\nIt was going deeper and deeper and he felt like being suffocated. His curiosity was strong but his fear was stronger now. He decided to back off but ----\nhe doesn't know which way to go. \"AH!\" he screamed when someone touched his shoulders. He shut his eyes and immediately went frozen. IS IT A GHOST??\n\"Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners--\"\n\"What the fuck are you doing?\" His eyes quickly opened when he heard ----\nthat familiar voice. \"C-Captain?\" He turned around and cursed himself for stuttering. \"You're here too?\" He feels nervous, now that he knew that he's talking to the real Jeon Jungkook.\n\"I thought you we're at the meeting--\"\n\"I am, but your father asked me to look for you,\"\n"},{"title":"9","data":"\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/7c7425f9b3e8cf126196aa13d79a5979aa76d190/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f2d794c6556756f763939414459513d3d2d33312e313639333337383236363236346565333639333333353731313839342e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\"50\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n50.\n\"L-Look for me?\" he pointed to himself and Jungkook nodded. \"Yes, he needs you in the meeting.\" He said and started walking away.\nTae followed him and it was a series of left and right. He couldn't even memorize because the turns are making him dizzy.\n--\nThey successfully got out of the maze like room and Tae felt relieved. He thought he's gonna die there. \nJungkook took the fashion book back to its place and the secret room was finally hidden behind the shelves again.\n\"He's in the office.\" Jungkook said before

\n<br>56.\nTae went outside of the house and saw how beautiful the interior it. He never knew that houses in the past we're these beautiful.\nThere are lots of plants and flowers. The lot of the house was very huge that you can build another mansion inside it.--\nHe went to side and found out that they have a farm. The farmers are all smiles but not until they saw Taehyung.\n\"M-Mr. Kim!\" they said and immediately took off their hats and bowed. Tae felt confused and he doesn't know what to do. They looked scared of him.--\n\"Good-afternoon sir! We are just having a bit of break and we'll immediately go back to work.\" The worker said while still bowing.\nTae looked around and it's almost sunset. From the looks of the farmer, they seem like they're working for the whole day.\n\"I-I think ----\nall of you should go home.\" Tae smiled but he was surprised when the workers fell on their knees and begged. \"Please don't fire us! This is our only hope to feed our families, please sir!\"\nTae was so confused. \"That's not what I meant. Why would I fire you? Please stand up.\"--\nHe helped the farmer stand up because he seemed a bit old and he might have trouble holding his posture. \"Please stand up, all of you.\" he said politely. He doesn't know why theyre doing that.\n\"What I mean is, you guys should rest first. There's still tomorrow, you ----\nworked hard today.\" He said and all of the workers looked so surprised and happy. \"R-Really? Thank you sir, thank you!\" Tae doesn't know but their smile seemed contagious to the point that he also smiled just by seeing those.\nHe doesn't know what he did. But he's happy.--\nHe left the place and it's already sunset. The workers went home and now, he's all alone in the farmland.\n\"Welcome to 1894.\" He flinched at the sudden voice. He turned around and saw an unfamiliar woman standing behind him. She looks pretty, and she's wearing a white dress.--\nTae felt awkward and let out a nervous laugh. \"Hehe, thank you.\" he said and turned back around to watch the sunset.\nWait a diddly darn minute.\nTae immediately turned back around with his surprised eyes. \"H-How did you know that I'm from the future?\" he asked the woman.--\n\"You wished for this, didn't you?\" Tae's furrowed his brows. Wished? He doesn't remember stating a wish. \"Pardon?\" \nThe woman smiled. \"You wished that you lived in the year where a very historical event happened, right?\" It slowly sank in Tae's mind.\nFuck. He thought.--\n\"W-What? H-How did you know that?\" Tae looked at him with judging eyes and hugged himself like he's covering his body. \"Are you my stalker?\" he asked.\n\"No, but I'm the one who granted your wishes.\" Tae chuckled. \"Are you saying that you're a fairy? Lol funny.\"--\nBut he slowly stopped laughing when he realized what he just said. He's already in 1894, he jumped back time. What's not possible now?\nHe coughed and fixed his voice. \"I did not actually mean that wish. It was just because of all the emotions I had that's why I said that.\"--\n\"You know the saying. . .be careful for what you wish for?\" she said and walked around him like he's encircling him. Tae looked down his foot, he's probably made a mess by wishing that.\n\"Don't worry, you're not the only one who wish for this.\" His ears rose. \"Wydm?\"--\n\"You're currently in the body of someone who looks exactly like you, even the name. He's a son of a General and is expected to be a soldier.\" She said.\nTae felt interested. \"What did he wish for?\" \n\"He wished to live in another generation, where he's free.\"\n"},{"title":"10","data":"--\n\"He doesn't want to take his father's steps. He don't want to be a soldier. The moment came and he felt tired of all the pressure to the point that he wished for this.\"\nTae nodded. \"So, how does that connect?\"\nThe woman looked at him, \"In conclusion, you exchanged souls.\"--\nTae has never been so annoyed and surprised in the same time. For real? They exchanged souls?\nHe laughed and smacked the woman jokingly on the arm. \"I didn't know you we're a comedian, haha funny. Next joke?\" He said but the woman was all serious.\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/e6f3591f49d6f6b28101981f944ea5d8d3687a23/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f526a2d344e77656b30486b5834673d3d2d33322e313639333532326131623732323266383939363039323731373235372e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\" Next joke?&quot; He said but the woman was all serious\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n58.\n\"Exchanged souls? Are you insane? You? eXCHANGED OUR SOULS?\" Tae never felt so offended in his life. \nHe scoffed. He can't believe what was happening. He thought that this was his body, and now he feels more awkward because he's touching something that's not his.<br>59. \n\"Its just the same as yours, dumbass. And don't complain. You will thank me after this.\" Tae gave her a deadly glare. He's never been so angry.\n\"Your mission is to find out what happened to Captain Jeon. Once you're done, I'll fetch u so u can come back to ur world.\"--\nTae sighed and tried to think about it. No one knew what happened to Jungkook. The sources only say that he saved Korea but it is not stated how. \nHe'll probably win a huge price if he gets to find out what happened. And of course, he will have the answer to his assignment.--\nHe sighed. \"Okay, fine. But promise me you'll fetch me here okay? I don't want to be stuck here.\" He said and the woman nodded.\n\"But remember, your mission is to find out what happened to him. Don't ever try to ruin history. Or even hinder in his life. It will ----\naffect the future and especially the past. Stick to your mission only.\" Tae slowly nodded and watched till the woman vanish from his sight.\nHe took a deep sigh. He's just going to find out what truly happened to Jungkook right? \nYes, just that, nothing more. He hope.\n\n                                <img

It was already 10 in the evening and everyone was asleep.\nTae successfully got outside and there we’re no people around — just lights. It felt creepy but It didn’t bother him.\nHe walked on the dark alley and ——\nStarted exploring the place with his eyes. Even though its already night, the sky it still somewhat bright. The breeze wasn’t freezing but rather calming. \nToday is October, 3 months before the historical event where Captain Jeon dies. It will happen on exactly New Year.—\nHow ironic. New Year is supposed to be a symbol of new hope, but that is where he dies. \nTae heaved a sigh. He’s not yet close with Jungkook but he felt sad knowing that he might witness his death.\n“Just stick to the mission Tae, you’re gonna be fine.” He comforted himself.—\nHe can already see the plaza from a far. But he felt something strange to the point that he went slower on his tracks.\nSomeone is following him. He can feel it. \nBut he didn’t want to be obvious. So he just continued to walk and walk until he can already hear the ——\nfootsteps behind him. His heart was beating so fast and he doesn’t know what might happen to him. \nWill he die here? \nHis body was trembling and he’s almost stumbling. Fortunately, he saw a soldier and he immediately ran to him.\n“Sir, plesse help me.” He cried.—\nAnd by that, he heard the footsteps no more. He somewhat felt relieved. “Mr. Kim Taehyung? What are you doing out here?” \nHe doesn’t know how he knew him but its probably because his father was a General.\n“S-Someone was following me awhile a-ago.” His voice was shaking.—\nThe soldier looked around but he saw no one. “Its very dangerous out here sir. You should be at home. Allow me to accompany you.”\nTae nodded and the soldier walked him home. “Thank you.” He said and the soldier saluted then left. \nHe leaned onto the gate and let himself ——\nslide down. It must be a bad idea to do his plan on the time of night. Especially when its already turning morning.\nHe breathed and tried to calm himself down. He quickly went inside the house and successfully got back in his room without anyone noticing.\n\n                                <img

There were so many people, lots of market place and business were going on. No wonder why its the capital.\nHe had his sling bag on and he just hopes that his mom did not notice him being gone. He just escaped home.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/da95ee90637deec2d00741205059f118cf57bbab/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f56754b754b794f5f6569575659673d3d2d313130323633343836342e313639333532613536343965633435653735323831333831393731332e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\" He just escaped home\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n81.\nTae kept his patience long. He’s not familiar of the place but he doesn’t care if he gets lost tho. His mission is to find out the historical mystery about Captain Jeon.\nBut where was he?\nBut finally, his eyes caught him — looking extremely handsome even from afar.—\nJungkook was talking to the group of soldiers — theyre more than a group tho. \n“Ha...bullseye.” Tae whispered to himself and quickly went to his direction. Not directly towards Jungkook — he hid behind the walls and watched him.\n“He’s really intimidating huh.” He listed ——\nit down to his notebook. All the moves he does, even his facial expressions were jotted down. He’s taking all the notes and he’ll probably just write it in an essay form later.\n“Your first mission is to inspect all the market places in the capital. I’m giving you——\nall until tomorrow for your report and observations. You may start.” \nTae stared at Jungkook — he’s all poised, and so in character. He looked even more manly by that. His eyes we’re big but it looks good on him — it looks fierce, but he wondered hows it like when he smiled.—\nHis face — he can’t say its average. Who the fuck can look good as that? \nHe looked like a very good leader and of course, a captain. But he looked young, maybe younger than Tae? How’s that possible?\nTae noticed that he was staring for too long. I mean who wouldn’t?\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/8cba9b1cdce3a86e1d391001a7b5db1b3ab50a3b/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f7449514536446244464553555a773d3d2d313130323633343836342e313639333532623832616137373935323235363832343031303036322e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\" I mean who wouldn’t?\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/17ef471d7cd645a1fa5bef100c704741f5aff4c7/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f786877716c4a4b52376550576c673d3d2d313130323633343836342e3136393335326238653133366463666433323036363139343538382e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"83\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n<br>83.\nTae slapped himself by his thoughts. He was kind of hurt because he didn’t expect too much pain.\n“Gosh, I probably looked like an idiot.” He said and massaged his cheeks.\nHe looked at the place where Jungkook was in but as to his surprise, he’s not in there anymore.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/336e722dff37214862ec4a9fe74fd0e15effe294/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f4c7048596d515f316c74443234673d3d2d313130323633343836342e313639333532626436393631643533393339343737343138343731372e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"He looked at the place where Jungkook was in but as to his surprise, he’s not in there anymore\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n85.\nTae immediately stood up and explored his gaze on the place but he couldn’t find him anymore.\nHe stomped on the ground due to annoyance. “Argh! I’m so dumb!” He cried and his brows we’re all furrowed.\nHe went out of that place and tried to look for him among the crowd.—\n“Shit, that’s him!” He cried and quickly swam over the crowd. \nHe bumped onto so many people and kept muttering ‘excuse me’ and ‘Im sorry’.\nIt seemed impossible for him to catch Jungkook because as soon as Tae was almost near him he would walk away.\nBut Tae didn’t give up.—\nJungkook was walking away and is now very far from him but Tae still kept an eye on him.\nHe was actually running already to try and catch him up but Jungkook took larger steps than him.\nJungkook stopped in front of a stall and talked to the vendor. Tae thought it was ——\nfinally his chance to catch him but as soon as he was going to hide and jot down informations, Jungkook walked away again.\nTae held onto the wall and breathed. “He’s so fast, gosh. Is he an ostrich?” He asked himself.\nAfter some seconds, he quickly followed him again ——\nand again. It was a series of running and walking and Tae noticed that he’s missing all the informations so he decided to jot down informations while following him. \nHe saw Jungkook stop and helped an old woman who was carrying a lot of things, maybe thats what she’s selling.\n"},{"title":"13","data":"—\nHe watched him carry the bags and placed it beside the streets where the old woman sells. He even helped the woman sit since the chair was too low.\nTae smiled to himself and his heart jumped. He’s really a hero, he doesn’t know why yet but this — his good heart tells it all.—\nHe managed to list it all down to the notebook and started following him again. \nIt been a moment of walking and Tae noticed that Jungkook was going on circles. \n“Where is he really going?” He asked himself. His legs we’re kinda getting tired because of running.—\nWithin just a blink of an eye, Jungkook went to the left and now, Tae couldn’t find him.\n“The heck? Did he enter another realm or what?” He told himself while looking around to find him.\nHe suddenly saw him enter a house — a cabin actually, and he immediately followed him.—\nThe inside was barely lit. And the walls are all made of wood. It seemed like its poorly built.\n“Why would he go in this weird house?” He asked himself. It was very silent, even the footsteps were heard. But he couldn’t hear Jungkook’s footsteps.\n“God, did I lost him again?”—\nHe asked himself while slowly looking around the place, hoping to see Jungkook again like how he did earlier. \n“Did I see it wrong? Did he not go in here?” Tae bit his fingers, he’s getting a bit anxious.\nHe sighed. He was about to leave when someone grabbed him ——\nand pulled him inside the the group of dividers and covered his mouth.\n“MRFHDHFJ!” His screams we’re muffled, only the sunlight on the tiny holes of the wall we’re the only light.\n“If you keep shouting the one who’s following you may kill you.” And by that, Tae went silent.—\nHe immediately knew it was Jungkook. But that didn’t matter for now because he saw someone with a covered face enter the room. He can see it through the folds.\nThe place in between the dividers were not quite enough to fit in two people.\nSo they’re basically glued to eo.—\nEverything was silent. He can’t even hear Jungkook breathe even thought he’s just behind him. \nHis heart was beating so fast while watching that person roam around the place — he looks like he’s looking for someone.\nAnd is that someone...him? \n“Stay in here, whatever ——\nhappens, don’t go out until I tell you.” He whispered to his ear and that gave him chills.\nJungkook carefully went out of one of the dividers but he’s barely seen since he’s inside the group of dividers. And he’s holding a sword.\nPause.\nhES HOLDING A SWORD?—\n“Who are you?” Jungkook asked and the culprit immediately got alarmed and held his sword. \nTae was shaking in fear. His trauma was getting back, and he feels so anxious — so anxious.\nWith a moment of silence, Jungkook sensed something and he immediately kicked all the ——\nDividers that was preventing him from being seen. And by that, him and the guy with covered face met eyes.\nThe guy’s eye bawled in shock as soon as they met eyes. He tried to run away but Jungkook was faster and quickly caught him.\nHe locked his neck in his arms and placed ——\nthe sword near his neck like he was about to cut it. “Why are you following me?” \nThe culprit was choking but he still managed to answer.\n“Y-you’re not the one—I’m foll—owing!” Tae saw Jungkook smirk.\n“Why are you following him then?” He asked but the culprit did not ——\nanswer, and that probably made Jungkook pissed. “Answer me.” He said in a firm tone and tightened his arm around his neck.\n“S-Some-one asked me to!” , “What in return?”\n“T-Three sacks of r-rice!” Jungkook clicked his tongue. He never thought a person can be this dumb.—\n“And who is that someone?” The guy did not answer and tapped Jungkook’s arm repeatedly until he stopped.\nHe’s dead. \nHe placed his sword back and went where Tae was hiding. He was shaking intensely.\n“He’s gone—fuck.” He cursed when Tae fell onto his arms. \nHe fainted.\n"},{"title":"14","data":"\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/de23fe9b16f7bb31fc42ee78808bd2f1cfa38f54/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f71347479375561487446626276513d3d2d33362e3136393335326633633437373962616236353035393631333037332e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"1535\" data-original-height=\"1920\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/41c51f54c8aab5ffdab59e314967964b1e925b98/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f53457962346837336b41516650513d3d2d33362e313639333532663437393162393433343333373534333938393131362e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"1535\" data-original-height=\"1920\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/065531ee4c5e20a7c451747dbda660105d4f413a/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f4261467951624a714655703159513d3d2d33362e313639333532663466626438373264663638363834323437303638392e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"1535\" data-original-height=\"1920\" alt=\"1\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n1\n88.\nTae fell on the bed with his eyes bawled. He barely remembers what happened awhile ago, but why the fuck is he with Jungkook?\n“You’re at my house. Don’t worry you’re safe here—“\n“hOUSE? DID YOU KIDNAP ME— wait no I’m an adult— DID YOU ADULTNAP ME?!” Tae cried while—\ncovering his body with his arms even though he’s fully clothed. Jungkook raised an eyebrow at him.\n“Pardon?” Tae was looking at him with inspecting eyes. He was 5 steps away from him.\nWhy would he bring him to his house? \nTae grabbed his shoes and pointed it a him like ——\nhe was threatening him. He was out of the bed and took steps backward so that the distance between them will be more bigger.\nJungkook took a step forward. “What are you doing—“\n“DONT. DONT COME NEAR YOU MUNCHKIN.” Jungkook looked so clueless about what he’s doing.—\n“Why am I here, what did you do?” Tae asked, his guards we’re still up and his eyes we’re pinned on Jungkook.\nThe captain sighed and crossed his arms above his chest. “Basically, you we’re following me and someone was following you. I caught the culprit and then you fainted.”—\nTae’s mouth opened but no words came out. He remembers it all now. \n“F-Followed you? Hah! Why the heck would I follow you—?”\n“Why the heck would you follow me?” Jungkook returned the question but Tae went silent and gave him a glare.\n“I said I didn’t!” He cried.—\nTae looked for his sling bag around the place and he found it on the bedside table. But he’s too afraid to get it since Jungkook was near it.\nJungkook noticed the glance and he immediately grabbed the bag. “Hey! That’s mine!” Tae said.\n“Why are you in the capital? ——\nShouldn’t you be in the training camp with your father?” Tae did not pay attention to his words and gathered his courage.\nHe went towards Jungkook and tried to grab his bag. Even though they’re just the same height, he couldn’t reach the bag because Jungkook held it up.—\n“Are you skipping training, Mr. Kim?” Tae glared at him.\n“Of course not! Give me back my bag!” Tae tried to grab it again but Jungkook was too god at this. \n“No, not until you tell me why you’re following me.” Tae was boiling inside. He knew he’s talking to a hero but he’s ——\ngetting pretty annoying. Tae had immediately thought of an idea.\nHe quickly kneed Jungkook on his stomach and it made him crouch in pain. “Ah!” He cried and Tae immediately snatched his bag.\n“I thought you’re a captain? Your speed skills are too bad.” Tae said and ran away.\n\n      <img

\n<br>108.\nFor the hundredth time, Tae roamed in the area. He went to the capital, to the plaza, and even tried to go to his house but Jungkook wasn’t there.\nHe’s been doing that for the past few hours, and the only thing that he has jotted down on his notebook were sketches.—\nFeeling his legs break, he decided to sit on the brick fences in the sidewalk. \nThere we’re so many people, and that didn’t help either. \n“Where did he go? There’s no way he’s gone far.” Tae muttered while catching his breath.—\nAs soon as that, he thought the skies heard his prayers.\nHe finally spotted Jungkook leaning on the wall in front of a huge house. The house seems elegant and you can already tell that the owner was somewhat rich.\nTae quickly opened his notebook and started taking notes.—\nFrom the date, day, atmosphere and where it happened. He listed them all. He wanted to be precise and specific.\nHe an old man came out from the house, but he looked like a high ranked official. They talked for a while and went inside the house.\n"},{"title":"17","data":"\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/d83e0598c75eaf1a49bca5692383c61706366a75/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f5141376b546546753758526d6c513d3d2d33382e3136393335333635376536616436633337393138393137303738352e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/6e6c62fb4e7aa7c4f2c391090dd6aee3f56ff451/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f4475714735494c577276396f52513d3d2d33382e313639333533363630316663633332333537303239393234373437322e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"110\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n110.\nThe gate was fortunately opened and there are neither guards nor person who saw him enter.\nHe tiptoed on the side of the house. It has so many windows, somewhat like an American style. \n“The owner is not Korean.” Tae quietly muttered. \nHe quickly went behind the ——\nside and leaned on the wall. He can somewhat hear what they we’re talking about.\n“Is it true?” \n“Yes sir. I’m here to ask your permission — I want to marry your daughter.”\nTae’s mouth went agape and his hands flew onto his mouth — covering it.—\nThe history did not talk about Captain Jeon’s love life so Tae is really stunned that maybe, this is the chance he’ll knew about what happened.\nHe heard the man sighed. “You’re a gentleman, a diligent guy and I’m glad that you’re a Captain. But I can’t agree about you ——\nmarrying my daughter — not until I hear her side. I’ll talk to her first and I’ll tell you if I can give you my permission.” Jungkook slowly nodded, informations processing in his mind.\n“I understand sir. Thank you for your time.” Jungkook stood up and bowed. \nTae was too ——\nimmersed in the conversation and didn’t even noticed that Jungkook has got out of the house. \nHe quickly gathered himself and ran after him. \nThoughts we’re wondering in Tae’s mind. He has so many questions but he knew none of them cane be answered for now.—\n“That girl is lucky huh? I wish I was her.” Tae laughed to himself with that thought. How ridiculous.\nHe followed Jungkook but this time, he’s more careful. He wore a scarf so that he can cover his face if needed. \nJungkook doesn’t seem to suspect anything at all.—\nJungkook went to the school — I mean military camp eh? Tae’s school was a military camp before.\nUnfortunately, there are soldiers guarding the front gate, and probably authorized people can be only one who can enter.\nTae cursed upon his breath. “How do I bypass them?”—\nA thought his mind and he’s very thankful for that. “Oh, I’m their General’s son. They should know me.” \nHe fixed himself and gathered his confidence. \nHe care-freely entered the gate and the soldiers even bowed at him. He mentally laughed and continued walking.\n—\n“Fuck, I lost him again!” He cried and bit his lip. How is he so fast? He literally just blinked and he’s already gone. \nHe decided to roam around the place. There are lots of soldiers training in the football field.\nHe smiled at the interiors of the building.

There are lots of soldiers training in the football field.\nHe smiled at the interiors of the building. He never ——\nTae sneaked inside. There’s a table, chair, a bookshelf, lots of papers, and some coats. \nIt looks more of an office. \nHe explored his gaze around. The interior was old but its so relaxing. The windows we’re opened and the wind was coming in.\n“So you’re not following me?”—\nTae flinched at the voice behind him. He knew it was Jungkook, and he also knew that he’s in danger.\nHe froze on his place and gulped. What should he say?\nHe gathered his courages and faced him with an attitude. \n“How many times do I have to tell you that I’m not?”—\n“How many times am I gonna ask you why?” \nHe returned the question again. Tae gritted his teeth. He’s never lost over an argument but Jungkook — he’s just real annoying.\n“It just happened that I entered this room. Stop imagining things.” Tae stuck his tongue out.—\n“Mr. Kim,” Jungkook took a step forward and Tae went backwards until he felt the table behind him. \nJungkook leaned forward and Tae doesn’t know what to do. \n“This room is my office. There’s no way you did not see the sign outside.” Tae gulped, their face were just ——\ninches away. “Not unless, you’re really following me—“ Tae kneed him on the stomach and he quickly crouched in pain.\n“If you come close again then say goodbye to your future babies.” Tae pointed his pen onto him like hes threatening him.\nAs if he’ll get threatened by a pen.—\nJungkook sighed. “Okay then.” He was about to leave when Tae asked a question. \n“W-Where are you going?”\n“To the bathroom. Are you gonna follow me and watch me pee?” Jungkook asked and Tae’s face turned like a tomato.\nHe’s been controlling his heart when Jungkook leaned ——\nforward. But now, its just too much to handle. \nTae grabbed the pillow on the chair and immediately threw it to Jungkook who’s smirking. \n“The fish is caught.” Jungkook said and Tae gave him a death glare. \n“Fuck u!” Tae wad about to leave but Jungkook held his wrist back.—\n“What now?!” Tae asked in an irritated tone. \n“I know you’re skipping training. I let it slide yesterday but I can’t now. I’m reporting you to your father.” Jungkook started to drag him out of the room.\n“EXCUSE ME? THERE’S NO WAY—LET ME GO!” \nHe knew he’s fucked up.—\n“Good morning sir,” They’re at the General’s office. Jungkook took a bow, and Tae was all nervous.\n“What brings you here? Why are you with my son?” The general asked calmly, but that didn’t help calm Tae either.\n“I do not want to sound rude sir, but your son has been ——\nfollowing me since yesterday and he’s skipping trainings.” Tae cursed under his breath. He was looking down at his feet because he doesn’t want to see the reaction of his father.\n“Is that true, son?” Tae went silent for awhile. He doesn’t know if he’ll tell the truth or not.—\n“Well...yes.” He bit his lip, still not looking straight. But he heard the sigh of his father. \n“Why are you skipping training? You know that it’s a sin to refuse responsibilities right?”\nTae just listened on the scolding. \n“Why are you following him?”<br>—\nOf all the questions, thats the hardest to answer. I mean, what would he say? \n‘Yo dad am following this hot ass to save history.’ \nLike that?\nOf fucking course not. Who the heck would believe that? They’ll probably just sent him to the hospital.—\nTae decided not to answer and his dad sighed. \n“I’m not gonna let this happen again.” Tae slowly nodded, showing that he’s listening to him.\nEveryone went silent. No one dared to speak. Jungkook was just standing still like a statue in the side — God, he’s so disciplined.—\nIt only took seconds and the silence was cut. “Captain, thank you for reporting this.”\n“No problem sir—“\n“I would like you to supervise my son.” \nTae’s head jolted up. Jungkook’s eyes we’re bawled. \n“What?” Both asked in unison. “I-I’m sorry sir, but what?” Jungkook asked.—\nThe general leaned back onto his chair. \n“I don’t know why my son is following you and why he is skipping trainings. And since I know I can trust you, I want you to guide and guard my son. Make sure he attend trainings and if need — discipline him.”—\n‘If needed — discipline him.’\nThose words kept echoing on Tae’s mind. His heart was ringing through his ear. He has a lot of thoughts rummaging through his head. \nOh my god.\n“S-Sir, I don’t think I can do that. I’m already a captain, I have more responsibilities——\n“You don’t have to worry about that. I can work on it. My only favor for you is to look after my son. If only I can then you wouldn’t have to do this.”\n“Sir—“\n“I don’t accept a no. You can start tomorrow. And Taehyung, we’ll have a talk at home.”\nThose we’re the words ——\nbefore they left the office, dumbfounded.\nTae immediately smacked Jungkook’s arm but he was the one who’s hurt. \n“Aw, do you have a rock in your arm?” He said while massaging his palm.\n“How dare you smack me?” Tae glared at him and stuck his tongue out.\n"},{"title":"19","data":"—\n“You see what you got? Another responsibility. You shouldn’t have reported me.” \nJungkook glared at him. He wanted to throw fists at him but he knew he’ll be in trouble when he did that to the General’s son.\n“You don’t have to do it if you don’t want to—“—\n“I’m not like you who disobey orders.” Tae was immediately shut down when Jungkook said that.\n“From now on, you can’t talk to me informally. And address me as your Captain. Are we clear?” Tae felt a bit intimidated by his voice.\n“Oh come on! I won’t tell dad—“—\n“I’m serious.” \nJungkook said in a firm tone. Even his expressions weren’t joking. So maybe, its not really the time to joke around for Tae.\nHe gulped &amp; saluted, “Sir, yes sir!” He saw Jungkook smirked before he left.\nTae punched the air out of anger. <br>“That doughnut!

\n<br>120.\n“Taehyung, wake up.” \nTae felt his mother patting his arm. His eyes we’re heavy and sleepy and he had no plans but to sleep till daylight. \nTae didn’t budge. After a few minutes, his mom started waking him up again. \n“Son, wake up now. It’s almost 3 am.”—\nTae groaned and shifted onto another position while pulling his blanket up. \n“Mom, it’s just 3 am and the sun is not up so I shouldn’t be too.” He said with his hoarse voice. \nHis mom sighed. “Its your first day of training since your dad told me that you’re skipping,”—\nTae hummed in response. But he’s still not getting up from bed. And it’s 3AM already. \n“Captain Jeon is outside. Isn’t it a bit disrespectful that you’ll let your senior wait for you?” \nWait a diddly darn minute.\nTae’s eyes shot open. He froze on his place.—\nHe looked at his mom and studied her expression, then went back to sleep. \n“You have talent on comedy mom.” His mother raised an eyebrow. “Son, I’m not kidding. He’s been waiting for you since 5 minutes ago.” \nTae sat bolt upright, his head felt dizzy with the sudden action.—\nHe quickly got up the bed and peeked through his window.\n“What the fuck.” He whispered to himself when he saw Jungkook standing in front of their house with his horse. \nJungkook noticed a presence and once he looked up, they eyes met. \nTae quickly hid behind the frames &amp; ——\nquickly went to his closet. “I’ve fixed all your clothes. You’ll be staying in the camp until your training is done.”\nTae looked at her with a shocked expression. “I’ll stay there for 2 and half months? What?” \n“Son, it’s part of your training. Just go wash your face ——\nand change your clothes then you may go.” Tae looked so shocked ay the informations. \n“I won’t eat breakfast?”\n“You eat breakfast in the camp.” His mom hugged him. “Take care okay? Don’t worry, you can visit home every weekend.”—\nTae did as what he was told. He grabbed his packed bag and placed the notebook and pen inside it so that he can still take notes.\nHe went out of the house only to see Jungkook looking so impatient. \n“30 minutes, 29 seconds and 96 milliseconds. What took you so long?”—\nTae’s brows shot upwards. “Did you really just count that?” He asked and Jungkook rode the horse.\n“Just follow my tracks.” He said and ran the horse, but he stopped on his tracks when Tae spoke.\n“Am I seriously gonna follow you while walking?” He asked.—\n“Maybe you’re still asleep. Your servants prepared the horse for you. Obviously, ride it and follow me.” \nTae gulped, his mind is loading while trying to look up for a good response.\n“I don’t know how to run a horse.” He said and it caught Jungkook off guard.\n"},{"title":"20","data":"—\n“Mr. Kim, you’re from a high profiled family so you should have received a horseback riding training.” He said but Tae went silent.\nHe’s not the owner of this body, so there’s no way he knew how to run a horse.\n“I’m serious, I really don’t.” Tae felt embarrassed.—\nJungkook sighed and looked around like he’s looking for a solution.\n“Alright, ride with me.” Tae was surprised. He knew he misinterpreted that.\n“Pardon?” , “You heard me. Come on, we’re getting late. I don’t like being late.”—\nTae tried his best to hop on the horse, a lot tries to be specific. But he only ended up hurting himself.\nJungkook had enough and hopped down to help Taehyung. \n“Place your left foot on the hook and then pull yourself up.”\nTae did as what he’s told, but this time ——\nits much easier because Jungkook’s hands we’re on his waist, and it helped him pull himself up to mount the horse.\n“AAAA!” Tae cried when he realized that it’s kind of high to be riding a horse. He immediately crouched down.\n“What’s wrong with you?” Jungkook whispered but ——\nTae heard him. “I did not know it’s this high!” He cried. \n“Sit straight. The horse can’t run while you’re holding onto him like that.” Tae slightly tried to sit up straight but whenever he looks down, he just goes back to his old position.\n“Mr. Kim, we’re already late.”—\nBut Tae did not listen to him. Instead, he tightened his grip on the horse.\nJungkook wanted to curse, but he knew that it’s disrespectful. Tae was sitting in front of him and he’s behind him. \nHe had enough and quickly pulled Tae’s shoulder to make him sit straight.—\n“GOD! Huhu, mommy.” Tae cried and he felt frozen on his seat. \nJungkook immediately ran the horse and it made Tae so shocked to the point that he’s almost cursing in his every scream.\n“LORD PLS DON’T FETCH ME YET”\n“WTF CAN YOU SLOW DOWN A BIT-“\n“HOLY MARY MOTHER OF GOD-“—\nTae was almost gripping onto Jungkook’s arms because he has nowhere to hold.\nPeople are looking at them in every road because of his screams. But one thing hit him.\nHe can feel Jungkook breathing through his nape and can even feel the warmth of his body. \nThey’re too close.—\nThey arrived at the school where their camp is. There are lots of soldiers, maybe because its the new batch for training. \nJungkook parked the horse onto the side and hopped down to help Tae unmount it.\nJungkook doesn’t know if he’ll laugh or be disappointed cause——\nTae almost fell on the ground because of his shaky legs. He looked seasick.\n“I’m alive, omygod I’m alive.” Tae said while catching his chest and gasping for breath. His hands we’re shaking.\nJungkook held back his laugh and coughed to get his attention.—\n“First call in five minutes. I’ll see you in the grounds.” Jungkook said before he left.\nTae held onto the horse. “Is Captain Doughnut really like that? I almost had a heart attack.” He said, talking to the horse.\nA lot of soldiers we’re awake now, and the first call rang.\n\n      <img

They we’re many so they got grouped together. But It was them who chose their members. Just seven.\nTae looked around and almost everyone knew each other. He felt anxious about the unfamiliar faces he’s ——\nlooking at. He doesn’t know anyone since he’s not from this era. \nLittle did he know, Jungkook was seriously keeping an eye on him — just as what the General ordered him. But now, he don’t know if he’ll approach him because he really looked out of place.\nLuckily, someone ——\npatted Tae’s shoulder. He’s also unfamiliar. Despite of that, his aura is very comforting like he’s radiating the energy of the sun.\n“Hey, have you joined a group already?” He asked, trying his best not to scare him. But who would be scared with that cute smile on his face?—\n“N-No, I haven’t yet.” He hesitantly said. “Oh, you can join our group! My name is Hoseok. Nice to meet you...?”\n“Taehyung. Kim Taehyung.” Tae smiled back. He already liked Hoseok because of his light aura.\nThey went towards their group, and now, they’re complete seven.—\n“Hi! I’m Kim Namjoon!”, “I’m Seulyeon.”, “My name is Jaehwang!”, “I’m Seokjin!”\nTae greeted them with a smile. They seem to have noticed Tae’s nervousness that’s why they try to light them up. \nBut they’re not finished introducing yet.\n“Hello, I’m Bogum. Park Bogum!”—\nBogum showed his gummy smile and his eyes smiled too. Tae thought that he’s cute. \nCaptain finally spoke. \n“I see all of you became acquaintances already. Now, time for the work.” \nAll of them stood up straight, faces straight too. But are they all straight?—\n“As to what I said earlier, five laps — jogging. You may start.” \nAll of them gathered up and started jogging on the laps. \nIt was just the 2nd lap but Taehyung already felt exhausted. His team members won’t even let off a sweat? Like how?—\nThey finished the 5th lap and Tae’s legs we’re almost giving up. He’s not used to this kind of things since all he do was draw and design clothes.\nThe soldiers gathered back up in the oval. Once everyone was done, the Captain ordered.\n“Another 10 lapped high-knees, ——\n20 push-ups, 20 sit-ups and 30 burpees. I’ll be watching.” \nTae’s jaw literally dropped in an instant. It’s just the first day but it’s this intense. \nHis members and other soldiers looks like its just a piece of cake for them. But Tae was worrying for himself since ——\nthe Captain said he’ll be watching. \nAll of them went to the laps and did the high-knee. But Tae stopped in the 3rd lap because his body is shaking already. \n“Taehyung, keep on going. The Captain will scold you.” Seokjin said while going further.\nTae took a breath and ——\ncontinued doing laps again. \nIt’s not time for the push-ups and others. Tae knew he’s bad at physical activities but now, there’s no way he can complain.\nHe finished everything but his body was already numb. He couldn’t even lift a finger. He was already lying down the ——\nground while the sun slowly shines on his face. \nBogum noticed him and approached him. “It’s hard isn’t it?” He asked and sat on the floor. Tae chuckled. “Yeah, very.” \nThe Captain announced that its already time for breakfast.<br>—\nTae felt excited. It’s finally breakfast.\nHe tried to stand up, but his muscles we’re hurting. So he ended up collapsing on the floor again.\n“I think you need help.” Bogum said and held up Tae’s arm, and slowly guided him to lift his body up. \n“Thank you.” Tae said.—\nThey both went inside the rooms with giggles on their face. They talked and talked until they realized they just made friends.\nJungkook was still watching him, eyes&nbsp; on shot like an eagle. He still don’t understand why Tae looked fragile and he doesn’t know how to run a horse—\nBut he knew he’ll find it out someday. \nMaybe, just not today.\n\n      <img

\n"},{"title":"22","data":"133. \n“Taehyung-ah, Captain is looking for you. He’s at the field.”\nNamjoon said. Tae was a bit curious about why would Captain doughnut call him. Tae got up the seat and slowly went to the feild, it’s 5 in the afternoon, and it’s almost sunset.—\n“Why? You miss me?” Tae jokingly said as soon as he arrived at the feild, seeing Jungkook casually riding the horse.\n“No.” Tae glared at him. “You can’t take jokes don’t you?” He rolled his eyes and crossed his arms.\nJungkook hopped down the horse.<br>—\n“I’m here to teach you horseback riding. Not for jokes.” Keeping his poker face on, he went to the other horse and showed Tae.\n“Just me?” Tae asked, pointing to himself. He heard Jungkook sigh. \n“All of them know how to run a horse. I’m really surprised that you don’t.”—\nTae stepped on the foot hook, he held onto the harness and he successfully mounted the horse. \nBut he immediately crouched down when he realized how high it is. He suddenly remember what happened awhile ago.\n“Oh my god, oh my god!” He cried, eyes tightly shut.—\nJungkook rode the other horse and watched Tae with a disappointing look. “Sit up straight, nothing will happen if you’ll be scared.”\nTae shook his head. “We’re not the same! You don’t know how much I hate heights.” He said, voice tone almost crying.\nJungkook sighed.—\nIt’s seriously making him crazy. How can a future soldier be fragile like this? \nHe waited for a few moments so Tae can adjust but all he saw were cries. “Pls, let’s not do this.” He cried.\nJungkook clicked his tongue. “The horse can feel if you’re afraid. It wont hurt you.”—\nTae thought for a bit. Maybe nothing will happen if he try again right?\nHe slowly tried to straighten up on his seat, his grasp were still tight on the harness. \nBut he realized that he’s finally sitting straight.\nHe opened his eyes and saw Jungkook smiling. He gasped.—\n“Oh god, did you just smile?” He asked and Jungkook’s smile immediately faded away.\nTae laughed to himself. Why would he not want anyone to see him smiling? “I’ll pretend I didn’t see that.”\nJungkook coughed and fixed his voice. \n“Just gently hit the horse with the rope ——\nattached on its harness if you want it to run. Just keep on hitting it if you want it to run faster. If you want to go left or right, just put the pressure on your body onto which side you wanted to go. To stop it, just lean backwards and it’ll halt.”\nTae nodded while ——\nlistening to his words. He hit the horse with the rope and it started walking. \nTae flinched at the sudden movement, the horse is going on circles and he eventually got used to it.\n“Ooo, this is nice.” He said while slowly trying to control the horse.—\nJungkook let Tae adjust first. After some minutes, he decided to speak. \n“Should we go for a stroll?” He asked and Tae immediately nodded with a big smile on his face. He’s so proud of himself because he can finally run a horse.\nThe went out of the camp, out to the ——\ncity that they’re in. The sun is already setting down, and it’s really visible since there are just trees and there’s no huge buildings yet.\nTae smiled to himself. He never knew its this relaxing to take a stroll without seeing any smoke coming out from the factories.—\nThe rivers are clean, the streets are full of plants and people who we’re sharing foods, talking and children playing.\nIts just too endearing to see this scenery, because in the future — all of these are gone.—\nThe horse suddenly groaned and lifted himself up. A pebble hit its eye because of the children that we’re playing with the stones.\n“AAA!” Tae almost fell off but good thing he’s holding onto the harness. \nThe horse suddenly ran faster — well faster than Tae could take.—\nHe was crouching back down again while screaming. Tears we’re falling down his cheeks because of fear. \nHe can’t halt it. The amount of speed was too much for him to handle.\nOn the other hand, Captain was following him with the same amount of speed. The people were —\n—\nlooking at them and went on the side to give them a way. \nThe horse isn’t stopping yet, Jungkook doesn’t know where it’s going but he’s really dead if something bad happens to the General’s son.\nThey we’re already in a forest, and all he can hear was his heart beat and ——\nTae’s cries. He heard something else coming but his eyes we’re all focused on Taehyung. \nAnother horse drifted on the front to stop Tae’s. At the horse’s surprise, it lifted its body up and groaned.\nBut this time, Tae didn’t get a hold. He slid down the horse and he ——\nthought he was gonna die. \nJungkook quickly hopped out of the horse to catch him but the other person was quicker than him. \n“It’s okay it’s okay, you’re safe now.” Bogum said while encircling Tae in his arms and caressing his back to calm him down. He was crying so hard.—\n“I’m never riding a horse *sniff* anymore.” Tae said in between his cries. He was shaking for real. I mean, who wouldn’t be scared when that happens.\nOn the other side, Jungkook had no choice but to just stand there and watch Bogum calm him down. \nHe slowly approached ——\nthem and Bogum immediately saluted, even though he’s sitting on the ground because of Tae.\n“I’m sorry sir but I followed the both of you when I what’s happening.” Bogum explained and Jungkook slowly nodded. \n“Thank you.” Bogum guided Tae to stand up, there are ——\ntear trails on his face, and he’s having a hard time to stand up because his legs we’re shaking. \nTheir eyes met, but Taehyung quickly looked away. He’s still bawling. “If it’s okay, I’ll take him back to the camp now.” Bogum asked.\nJungkook had no choice but to ——\nnod since it looks like Tae wouldn’t want him to be the one to take him back to the camp. He probably pushed him off too much.\nBogum bowed and rode his hoarse with Tae in front of him. He made sure he’s comfortable enough before he run the horse.\nJungkook sighed.—\nDid he push him that hard? I mean, he’s a future soldier, he needs to be used to this.\nBut for him, Tae felt like somebody else. Not just a person, or a soldier. But he can’t tell what.\nHe rode the horse and went back to the camp with his head full of thoughts.\n"},{"title":"23","data":"134.\nFor the hundredth time, Tae shifted onto another position but he still couldn’t sleep. The amount of thoughts in his head was making it harder.\nHe was sleeping in the camp, probably gonna live there for how many? 2 months and half? Oh he hope he’ll last long.—\nEach team has a room, it would have been fun if his teammates are still awake, but all of them are sound asleep.\nHe decided to leave the room and take a walk in the hallways. Its nit actually that dark because even though its 11PM, the sky is still a bit light.—\nHands behind him, quietly wandering around the place. He’s never seen his school in night time, and even though its the old design, he’s still amazed.\nHe stopped in front of a tree beside the field, the shadows of it’s leaves looks really comforting. \nHe decided to sit ——\nunder it and lean onto the trunk. He looked up to the sky, stars are winking at him.\nIf he only knew how beautiful the night sky was, then he would have chosen to look at it than spend the night watching dramas and drawing designs.\nAnd it felt a bit sad. The sky ——\nisn’t supposed to look this beautiful. The twinkling and shining stars made it even sad. Its bright, but it’s dark. Just like him. \nThe sky has its secrets. The dark night sky looks beautiful, but you never know what it’s hiding.\nToo bad, Tae was the sky.—\n“I still wonder, wonder, beautiful story. Still wonder, wonder best part. I still wonder, wonder next story. I want to make...you mine.”\nTae sang, it’s his self composed song. But he never let anyone hear it, just him and his piano.\n“You have talent, Mr. Kim.”—\nHe flinched at the sudden voice — well, he actually almost jumped. Who wouldn’t be surprised?\n“Oh my...can you stop being so creepy?” He cried, his hand catching his chest.\nJungkook was beside him, sitting too. But he never noticed since he’s hidden in the shadows.—\n“Why are you here? You should be in your assigned room.” Jungkook wore his cap and sat straight on the ground.\n“I...” Tae paused, “I can’t sleep. I have insomnia.” He said and heaved a sigh.\n“I have too.” Jungkook said while looking at the sky. Tae sounded interested.—\n“Really?” He inspected Jungkook’s face and then frowned. “You don’t get enough sleep but you still look fresh.” Tae muttered, but Jungkook heard him.\n“While me, I look like a panda.” He cried, his face getting longer. \nJungkook looked at him, “You don’t look like a panda.”<br>—\nTae bit his lip to control his smile. “Really? Do I look cute then?” He asked and looked at him with eyes blinking repeatedly.\n“No,” Jungkook paused. “You look like a zombie.” \nTae’s smile faded away. He immediately smacked his arm. \n“Haha, funny.” Then rolled his eyes.—\nAfter that, silence reigned in them. No one dared to speak, just the crickets and the defeaning sound of silence. \n“Mr. Kim,” Jungkook started. Tae looked at him. “Yes?”\n“Are you...” Jungkook hesitated. “Are you okay now?” He asked, referring to the incident earlier.—\nTae’s mouth opened, but no words came out. He looked away and bit his lip. He never knew Jungkook cared. \nHe faced him, “Well, kind of.” Tae said and Jungkook nodded. He stood up and fixed his clothes. \n“That’s good to hear. Go to sleep now, we have a morning call tomorrow.”—\nTae nodded and smiled. “Goodnight, Captain!” He greeted, but Jungkook didn’t bother to look back and continued walking. \n“No, ‘goodnight toos’?” He shouted, but it was just silence who answered him. He sighed. \n“He’s cute but rude.” He stood up &amp; went back to their room.\n\n      <img

\n"},{"title":"24","data":"141. \nAttacking from behind, Tae decided to surprise his mother who’s busy watering the flowers.\n“Oh!—Oh my, Taehyung!” His mom cried in happiness, a smile immediately painting their faces. They pulled each other for a hug, he missed his mom.\n“Good thing you’re here! Your——\nsiblings are coming home today.” Tae broke the hug, his face looking unbelievable. “S-Siblings?” He stuttered, not believing what he heard.\n“Yes! I forgot to tell you before that they’re coming home today. Oh my, I’m very sure you missed them.” \nHis mom really looked ——\nhappy because of the news. I mean, maybe it’s because she’s a mother. \nBut Taehyung on the other side, just nodded. He thought that he’s the only child in this family, but nuh-uh. \n“Oh, they’re here!” Tae felt a bit nervous about meeting his siblings, he had no idea ——\nif they’re on good terms. \nHis mom immediately went to the gate, Tae was just frozenly standing there while waiting for his siblings to show up.\nThere are horses, also some servants. He knew they’re rich, but&nbsp; he’d never experienced this kind of royal-like treatment.—\n“Taehyung-ssi!” The girl immediately ran towards him and gave him a hug. Her gummy smile was really contagious and for no reason, it made Tae smile too. \nShe’s probably his sister. \n“Did you miss me? Did you? Aww, really?” She’s really hyper, and she didn’t even wait ——\nfor Tae to answer her question. She smacked his arm and laughed playfully. She looked younger than Taehyung, so he’s suspecting that it’s his younger sister?\n“Yeah, maybe.” He responded in an awkward smile. How is he gonna tell them that they don’t know them?—\nA guy came inside too, he looked really intimidating, especially because his eyes we’re like a tiger.\nBut all those intimidations faded when he showed off his gummy smile. He went to Tae and gave him a hug. \n“How have you been?” The guy asked. But Tae felt frozen because ——\nhe’s still trying to sink it all in his head. “I-I’ve been good. Thank you.” He responded.\nAll of them we’re about to go inside when their father came in. \n“Dad!” The girl cried and immediately ran to her father for a hug. “Just right on time, I missed you too Jennie.”—\nBut his brother just stood there and saluted to their father. “Good morning, dad.” But their father did not even spare him a glance, just a nod. \nTae felt odd. His brother must have been in the military already since he knew those. But why is his dad ignoring him?—\nTheir dad went inside with her sister. His mom came to his brother and hugged him. \n“Don’t mind him, Yoongi. I know he missed you too.” His mom comforted him and went back inside. \n“Hyung, are you okay?” He addressed him ‘hyung’ since he found out that he’s older.—\nYoongi gulped and pulled out a smile. He nodded, “Of course I am. Come on, let’s go inside.” \nTae jus watched him enter the door. He knew he wasn’t okay. But he still felt awkward to ask since he’s not that knowledgeable of what was happening. \nHe sighed and went inside.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/9fd0e433c72f9f7eba41b601bc658785ca0fb894/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f68663255506a58374b6f657872513d3d2d34352e313639333633363032653463356436653835383332363537363433322e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\"He sighed and went inside\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/175d4c3e17026117380f64ff416d803b19d04ebc/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f506b494659376677616b34762d773d3d2d34352e313639333633363063396162356465303837343735383039353030372e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"548\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/a9bb5b4548094c048fb53515712d3b0c53a573f1/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f2d4f307243676d6747706b7a4f773d3d2d34352e313639333633363135643739386464323532353838313133313930312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"494\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/12ce1201eadd9a1cf80983ae1d29861fe0a97634/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f66584267556b4b6b6f4e656d77513d3d2d34352e313639333633363165333839323438303231353330343235303933372e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"145\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n<br>145.\n“Good morning, Captain!” Tae entered the office and he saluted to him.

He sat on the chair in front of his table office and placed his feet above the table. \n“Well can you get me some Americano, aglio e olio—“ he stopped and looked at Jungkook, only to see his raised eyebrows.—\nTae giggled and quickly got up. “No seriously, I’m just here to say something.” He said.\nJungkook leaned forward and grabbed a paper and read it. “What is it?” He asked.\n“Hi.” \nJungkook looked at him with unbelievable eyes. He raised an eyebrow, “Pardon?”\n—\n“I said hi.” Tae smiled like ‘:3’. He thought it was amusing. “That’s what you’re gonna say?” \nTae nodded, smile still not leaving his face. And his bread cheeks are making him even cuter.\nJungkook massaged him temples, he doesn’t know if he’ll laugh or be annoyed.—\n“Look Mr. Kim, I’m a busy person. I have no time for your jokes so If you’re not gonna say something important, please leave.” \nTae pouted and crossed his arms. “A simple ‘hi’ is important too! You know some people needs someone to talk to especially when they’re stressed.”—\n“I don’t need someone to talk to.” Jungkook said and started writing on an empty paper, maybe answering some business messages? \n“But dad told you to take care of me!” Tae’s pout became even longer. \nJungkook stopped, and spared him a look.—\n“Your dad only told me to keep an eye on so he can make sure that you’re attending trainings. I’m a Captain, a soldier — not a baby sitter.” Tae’s mouth flung open by his words.\n“You think I’m a baby?” Jungkook felt nervous, he thought he went too far and annoyed him.—\nBut it was just a false alarm. Tae immediately smiled and bit his lip like he’s controlling himself to smile even more.\n“Well, I can be your baby.” He giggled.\nBut Jungkook was getting a bit pissed. “Please leave.” \nTae’s pout was back again. “You’re no fun.” And went out.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/97fe8fb85aa19d1951ddae1e35e7eb24f5ba804f/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f454741633549477934794e444f413d3d2d34352e313639333633373935313035636166353838303933323838313238392e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"” And went out\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/678117315c9607797caf50347eed1ce8c36f06fd/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f4f6b317266584c534572647a66513d3d2d34352e313639333633373962333565663533343138393733303438343531332e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"600\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/2ee37c80f20759b70d8210792c0b27c3ab9e3691/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f7a362d34646d626f424b724958513d3d2d34352e313639333633376135616666393166343134393237383139343231372e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/22529ce0eb634217a0c706a3180d029aabd4b610/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f71316732735538574a76423641413d3d2d34352e313639333633376230343730663131393238373132343437303234332e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/5ed8eea845c06f86e66d1fff8dee45de283acc12/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f326930774c6f487a734d374f2d773d3d2d34352e313639333633376239306130643933653937373739393631363333372e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n"},{"title":"25","data":"150.\nTae felt like a real spy on his case. He was following Jungkook, but he kept on being careful since he can’t be caught.\nJungkook did not go far away, but Tae was really surprised an confused of what just happened.\n“Why is he...unlocking my dad’s office?” He asked himself.—\nHis eyebrows furrowed. Jungkook was already inside the room, but he closed the door again so Tae couldn’t see what he’s doing.\nTae bit his lip, “What is he doing there?” He was crouching behind the walls. There was a window but he couldn’t see well.\nEven if he go and ——\npeek in, his shadow would be seen. So thats not so safe to be honest. \nJungkook took some time inside, probably 5 minutes until he finally came out. \n“Its that purple notebook again.” Jungkook was holding the notebook in his left arm, that was the nb that Tae saw earlier.—\nJungkook locked the office and went back to his own one. While Tae, was left thinking in the corner. \n“Why did he go there? What did he do?” He kept on squeezing his head with the possible answers but it only gave him aches. \nTae looked up to the building, just a few —❗️WARNING\n-murder/suicide<br>- if ur uncomfortable abt this topic pls skip this chapter.—\ndistance far from him. He saw a guy, but he couldn’t see his face since the edge was facing his back. \nTae’s hand flung towards his mouth — covering it. “Oh my...!” The guy fell down the high building, his back falling first. \nTae doesn’t know what to think, did he just ——\nwitness a suicide? \nEven though its their training break, there are still many soldiers who chose to stay in the camp. \nThe place around the victim was getting crowded. Lots of people are joining in so he decided to go and see.—\n“What’s going on?” He saw Jungkook coming out from his office, diving in the crowd. \nThe soldiers quickly made way for him and saluted. He saw the dead body, it was holding a handkerchief. \nJungkook looked up and saw a guy above, its hard to see but the guy looks shocked.—\nThe police and some detectives arrived. Captain ordered the soldiers to go back to their rooms, no going out until he said. \nTae was about to go back in his room when Jungkook stopped him, “Stay beside me,” Tae felt confused, but he did it anyways.—\nThe detective and the policemen inspected the crime. They also caught the suspect from above the building and he’s spacing out. Probably still shocked. \nTae lowkey looked at Jungkook who’s looking so serious. He was staring at the victim’s body and also the suspect.—\nAfter some minutes, the detective came to them. “From the infos that we gathered, this case is a murder. The suspect pushed the victim down and the handkerchief belongs to the suspect since it has his name. The victim probably pulled it when he’s being pushed.”—\n“Case closed, thank you for reporting Captain.” The detective saluted at him. He was about to leave when Jungkook spoke.\n“No, case not yet closed. I’m sorry to meddle in the case but I don’t think this is a murder.”\nThe detective looked back with questioning eyes.—\n“What do you mean?” \n“I can prove it all with the handkerchief.” The detective seemed intrigued. \n“If you’ll look at the suspect’s clothes, there are no pockets. Now try looking at the victim’s clothes.” \nThe detective tried to give a look on both that mentioned.<br>—\nAnd he was surprised that he’s right. There are no pockets in the suspect’s clothes while there are two in the victim’s pants. \nHow did he not see that?\n“May I know the victim’s name?” Jungkook asked and the detective hesitated first but he still gave it.\n“RJ Walker.”—\nJungkook smirked, as If he knew he was right. “May I have the handkerchief?” And they handed him the handkerchief. \n“The suspect’s name is Jin. Its written on the handkerchief so it probably belongs to him. How can you explain that?” \nJungkook shook his head. “It’s not his.”—\n“Yes, the handkerchief has ‘Jin’ on it but if you’ll rotate it on the left, it says ‘RJ’.” Jungkook demonstrated it and showed them. \nIt really says RJ. \nThe detective’s mouth flung open.\n(If u cant read hangul, the 1st pic says Jin &amp; the 2nd is RJ) https://t.co/oBIXVxIFMY\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/4d6958b9eac7f45450034cc9e459b3f42021ee9b/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f72732d796e4c3564624a564562773d3d2d34362e313639333633616437626635316539373934353231343333373231312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"146\" data-original-height=\"142\" width=\"146\" height=\"142\" alt=\"co/oBIXVxIFMY\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/f9ddf391fed693d14bc91352866485c8b93c90ca/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f324e3237566133344a5a515074413d3d2d34362e313639333633616635373762316666343933353336373532363537312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"142\" data-original-height=\"146\" width=\"142\" height=\"146\" alt=\"—\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n<br>—\n“And the suspect’s name isn’t Jin.

So isn’t it odd that he’ll name himself just ‘Jin’?” \nThe detective felt a bit humiliated, but he’s right.—\n“Okay, that’s a good point. But the victim fell on his back, who would do suicided by jumping down a building with it’s back first?” \n“I have a witness,” he paused and looked at Tae. “Mr. Kim, didn’t you saw them both up the building right before the victim jumps?”—\nTae doesn’t know how to respond. “Well, yes I saw them but I—OH MY GOD!” Jungkook smirked, he knew Tae realized what he’s talking about. \n“I get it now! I saw them both up but the distance between them is big. Like 2 meters. Theres no way u can push sum1 with that distance.”—\n“And how can I confirm that?” The detective wanted to make sure about what he’s hearing.\n“Sir! I’m sorry to meddle in the talk but what Taehyung said is right.

That was awesome!” Jungkook just shook his head. \n“How did you know I saw it?” He asked. \n“You’re very obvious. You we’re following me.

\nTae quietly went towards him, Jungkook was facing his back and he seemed to focused to notice a presence behind him. \nTae peeked on what he was doing, and he saw that he’s drawing something. \n‘Why is he drawing guns?’ He thought, but still amazed by the talent.—\nIts that purple notebook again. The same notebook that Tae was curious about. It seemed too special for Jungkook, and he wanted to find out why. \n“Woah, spare me some talent.” Jungkook almost jumped on his place when he heard a voice behind him. He was so startled and ——\nhe almost threw the notebook away.&nbsp; He turned around and closed his eyes in annoyance when he saw who it is. \n“What do you want?” Jungkook asked, hiding the notebook behind his back. Tae pouted and pointed the notebook by his lips. \n“Why are you drawing guns?” He asked.—\n“Because I want to.” Jungkook dared to leave, but Tae blocked his way. “I believe there’s another reason.” \nJungkook tried to go on the other side but Tae blocked it too. “Why are you ignoring me?” \n“I’m not ignoring you.”\n“Yes you are.”\n“No I’m not.”—\n“Cross your heart?”\n“Hope to die.” \nTae was about to speak again when he realized what just Jungkook said. Hope to die? He will, but Tae was wishing that this time — history will spare him. \nJungkook escaped him, but Tae still followed him behind. “What if you really die?”—\nTae asked, he wanted to know what Jungkook would feel. “I’m a soldier, I’m born to die.” Tae couldn’t help himself but to feel sadder. \nHe could’ve not asked him that, and now — his heart hurts. \n“Where are you going?” Tae asked, trying to make the atmosphere lighter.—\n“Why would I tell you?” \nThey we’re walking while talking. “Because I’m cute.” Tae giggled. Jungkook looked back. \n“How does that connect?” He asked. “You should tell me because I’m cute.” He flashed his boxy smile and Jungkook just shook his head.—\n“Look, I need to do my tasks. And I can’t do that when you’re following me like this. Please mind your business.” \nTae pouted and glared at him. “You’re mean, really mean.” He rolled his eyes and turn around to leave. \nHe hasn’t gone that far yet but someone came to him.—\n“Taehyung!” Bogum called, running towards him with his gummy smile. Tae’s face lit up. “Hey!” He greeted back. \n“Good thing I saw you. I’m currently doing horse back riding. Wanna join?” Tae felt a bit awkward. “I-I don’t want to ride a—“ \n“Nothing will go wrong. I promise.”—\nBogum held Tae’s wrist, and Jungkook’s eyes caught it. He watched them go to the field until they’re far away now. \nJungkook sighed and felt different. He can’t explain the feeling and he doesn’t want to know. \nHe shrugged it off and went back to his business.—\nOn the other hand, Tae felt uncomfortable about riding the horse. But Bogum, he’s really guiding him. \nTae let out a shaky breathe and Bogum noticed it. \n“Don’t worry, we wont go out. Just in the field.” He rode the other horse and flashed a smile.—\nThey started going on circles in the field, little by little, Tae is starting to feel comfortable riding a horse again. And that made Bogum smile. \n“I’m sorry If I dragged you into this. But you know, we ride a horse on wars. And I just want to help you be comfortable again.”—\nTae chuckled. “I know, that’s why atleast I forced myself too. And I’m glad I did cuz I feel a bit relaxed now.” \nThey continued going circles, slowly and sometimes hastening their movements. \n“Hey...I just...I just wanna thank you.” Tae started. “For what?”\n—\n“For saving me in the forest last week. I really thought it was the end of me. But you came, so I would probably consider this my second life.” \nBogum chuckled. “Its okay. But if that happens again, don’t panic okay? Mind over matter.” He advised.—\nTae glanced at Bogum. His face looks angelic, he smiles a lot, and he really seems approachable. \nUnlike SOMEONE HE KNEW. \nTae randomly looked into the building and he saw Jungkook looking at him. \nHe immediately waved at him and flashed a smile, but he just went away.—\nTae giggled. He thought it was cute. He’s really doing his best to obey what his father ordered him.\nAnd Tae felt safe.\nHe knew Jungkook would always be there. Even if he’s not looking, he knew Jungkook has his eyes on him.\nNever in his life, did he ever felt this safe.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/e7126a7ccf4a5dfcb0ceabc753ea176368435f29/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f4e37366c4c593373726f744945673d3d2d34372e313639333633666566643231316431633636393430383031393133302e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"Never in his life, did he ever felt this safe\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n159.\nFor the past few weeks, Tae still kept following him around. He did not care if he's obvious or not. He just goes with the flow.\nAnd he's really thankful that Jungkook isn't mentioning anything about it anymore. Maybe, that's what made his job easier.\nBut that notebook ----\nis really bothering him. He knew there's something inside it since Jungkook has been obviously protecting it. \nWhat's so special with that notebook that even a hero protects it?\nToday, Tae wanted to solve all of his questions. He made a plan, he needs to get that notebook.\n"},{"title":"27","data":"--\n\"Hi Captain!\" Tae met him on his way, he was walking in the hallway and as usual, his brows we're furrows. He seemed so stressed today.\nJungkook did not pay attention to him and continued walking. But Tae just kept following him. \"Have you eaten today?\" he asked.\n\"No.\"--\nTae's mouth flung open. \"Since breakfast? It's lunch now, you should eat!\" he said but Jungkook did not respond. Tae thought of another way of starting a conversation.\n\"Where are you going today?\" \n\"None of your business.\" Jungkook went upstairs, and Tae still followed.--\n\"Why not?\" Tae asked, trying to lighten up the mood.\n\"Just go.\" Jungkook said, his voice seemed really serious, but that didn't throw Tae off. \"Why would I?\"\n\"Because I said so.\" \n\"But I want to follow you.\" Tae flashed him a smile, but nothing happened.--\n\"Stop following me.\" Jungkook said, he was hastening his steps, trying to leave Taehyung back. But Taehyung hastened his steps too.\n\"I won't. Are you okay? You look stressed.\"\n\"Go away.\"\n\"No, we're friends so--\"\n\"I SAID GO AWAY!\" Jungkook stopped and looked back at him.--\nOnly to see Taehyung's surprised reaction. He was frozen on his place. he did not expect the sudden thunder of Jungkook's voice. He doesn't like being shouted at, he felt scared.\nHe's tearing up.\n\"Stop following me and we're NOT FRIENDS! We're not close, we're not related!\"--\n\"Stop acting like we're pals. In the first place you shouldn't be talking casually to me. I am your Captain, and you are my subordinate. That's how we're ONLY related. Do you understand, Mr. Kim?\" \nJungkook's voice was getting louder, he was breathing furiously.--\nHe did not even notice that Taehyung was shaking in fear. \nTae felt a lump in his throat while trying to process everything that Jungkook said. \nAfter some while, Tae held his face up and saluted, \"Sir, yes sir!\" he cried.--\n\"I'm sorry if I see you as my friend, I never thought you don't see me the same. My apologies, Captain.\" Taehyung forced a smile to hold his tears back.\nHe bowed and did not take a glance at Jungkook's reaction. He doesn't want to see his reaction because he'll surely cry.--\nJungkook watched him walk away. He was too furious to realize the ache in his heart the moment Taehyung stated those. \nHe knew he was wrong to say that, but It's too late to take it back. He ran his fingers through his hair and clicked his tongue.\nWhat a day for him.--\nTaehyung ran to a tree, the same tree where he saw Jungkook that night. \nAnd right when he reached the tree, he burst.\nAnger and hurt. All of his realization flooded his mind and that even made the tears fall.\n\"I forgot that he's a Captain, &amp; I'm just nothing.\"--\nMaybe, he really went to far. Maybe he's really trying hard. Maybe, maybe he's really the wrong one.\nThat angelic face and voice turned so dark awhile ago. He felt safe around him but at that moment, it was the same amount of fear.\nHis body was still shaking. He hates it----\nwhen people shouts at him, when people betray him, when people invalidate him. \nAnd he hated it even more because he's too sensitive. He was supposed to be angry, but those madness immediately turns into tears.\nHe's such a baby. A cry baby.--\nTwenty minutes had already passed when that happened, but his tears aren't still stopping.\n\"Why am I hurt like this? I'm not supposed to be.\" he said in between his cries. He wiped tears with his handkerchief.\n\"I cared too much about him. Maybe that's why. I'm so dumb.\"[ TIME SKIP : FEW WEEKS LATER ]\n--\nAnd it remained like that, ignorance and pretending like they don't see each other.\nTae did not forget about his mission, but for now, he's still sullen. He's still hurt. And he doesn't know when it'll be over.--\nLittle did he know, Jungkook was still there. He was still protecting him from afar. Even just by watching, Jungkook managed to keep him safe.\nAnd Taehyung never noticed those. He's too busy training and distracting himself from him. \nAtleast, Jungkook was thankful that ----\nTaehyung had friends -- his team mates. \nThey're helping him in the things that he can't. And probably, make him laugh. Atleast, that's what he's thankful for now. \n\"Captain, let's go.\" Lieutenant Han said. They had some missions in the other city and they're leaving today.--\nJungkook nodded and took a last glance at Taehyung who's practicing how to shoot with a gun &amp; he left. \nHeart still heavy, he knew one day he'll have to apologize. He can't do the General's mission for him if they're like this. \nHe can't always protect him from afar.--\n\"Water break from 15 minutes!\" the trainer announced. After that, all of the soldiers went to the side to rest and drink some water. \nNamjoon noticed that Tae was looking for something. \"What's wrong Tae?\" he asked.\n\"I think I left my bag in the room.\" he said.--\nHe immediately went on his way towards their designated room. He unlocked it and went inside to get his bag. \"Why did I not bring you?\" he asked the bag. \nHe went outside, locking the door. But even before he leaves, a hard object swung onto his head.\nHe lost consciousness.\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/cf4fbe2e8875e927c1b47292c80a0a661090a26f/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f66513677624335634c7454457a513d3d2d34382e313639333634333362356561323931393531373236393632393133342e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"1096\" data-original-height=\"1920\" alt=\"He lost consciousness\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/46efb17fdd82ce71394c23d6061bfdb0fad2cf74/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f4a46725a4f686367706f773367413d3d2d34382e3136393336343334323236363465316537343532393031373737372e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"1096\" data-original-height=\"1920\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n"},{"title":"28","data":"162. \nTae was shaking intensely. His heart beat was faster than normal and he’s literally panicking. \nWho wouldn’t? He’s in the edge of a cliff and one wrong move, he’ll immediately slide down. \nHe hates heights, so fucking much. Its not even funny.—\nHe tried to push the sledge backwards so that it would go away from the edge atleast. \nBut that just made the sledge slide down even more. \nTears we’re falling from his cheeks. His hands &amp; feet we’re tied and even his mouth was covered by a handkerchief.—\nHe even thought that he’s gonna faint soon due to the speed of his heartbeat. \nBut he knew nothing would happen if he just cried. He started moving his face and mouth muscles and he succeeded, the handkerchief was now down his neck. \nHe gasped for air, &amp; started to shout.—\n“HELLO?! ANYONE IN THERE?!” He cried. No one responded. \n“PLEASE HELP ME! I BEG YOU PLEASE!” He cried once again but only the echoes answered him back. \nHe kept on shouting, and shouting. His voice is already hurting because of it. \nHe’s losing hope, no one is answering.—\nThe sun is already setting down, and that made him sigh, and tears fell again. \n“PLEASE...Please...help me please...” his voice is getting weak and it even cracked. Until he had no energy anymore and just started crying.—\n“Why do I have to experience this? What did I do?” He said in between his cries.\nHe suddenly saw a letter down on the floor of the sledge. It was beside his foot, but he can read it well. https://t.co/U3AXngEeyu\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/f45c2506201225cbf69786cc6bda51b387d27329/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f7a72573130486e492d4151646a513d3d2d34392e313639333634346135663961666166383232323636353434393934372e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"1535\" data-original-height=\"1920\" alt=\"co/U3AXngEeyu\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n—\nAfter reading that, he knew he had lost hope. \nBut a person came by his thoughts. That person who was ordered to take care of him. That person who always keeps an eye on him. That person whom he felt safe with. \nAnd that person who gave him pain that he’s never felt before.—\nHe chuckled, “Why would he save me? He said he doesn’t see me as a friend. He said we’re not related. He’s a Captain, I’m just his subordinate. He won’t care even if I die.” \nHe muttered to himself. But on the side, he was still hoping — hoping that he’ll come and save him.—\nHe waited, and waited, and waited, until it was already night. \nNo one came. \nHe gasped at the sudden movement of the sledge. It’s starting to slide off again. But this time, it’s continuous. \nTae felt so scared — so so scared. Maybe, this is his end?—\nHe did not even get to thank his friends for cheering him up. He did not even get to say goodbye to his mother. \nAnd lastly, he didn’t even get to see Jungkook. \nTears started falling again, he’s accepting it now. Its his time.—\nThe sledge reached the end, it was just only a few slides more and he’ll fall down the cliff. \nTae closed his eyes. With his heavy heart, he knew he had to accept his fate now. \nAfter all, he lived a good life. \nThe sledge reached the end, and it finally slid off the edge.\n"},{"title":"29","data":"163.\n“Tae? Honey? Omygod!” Taehyung’s brows furrowed as soon as he opened his eyes. He was still adjusting to the brightness. \nHe was lying on the bed, his family is surrounding him. And his mother was crying. \n“Thank goodness.” His father muttered.—\nYoongi looked worried but happy now, and Jennie was crying also. “I thought we’re going to lose you.” She said in between her cries. \nWhile Taehyung on the other side, was still confused. “W-Where am I?” He asked, feeling his head beat in pain. \n“You’re in our house, Tae.”—\nYoongi said and it slowly sank in Tae’s mind. \nThe last thing he can remember was the cliff. The sledge was almost falling and thats where he fainted. He couldn’t remember any further. \n“Honey, don’t think too much okay? You’re safe now, all thanks to Bogum.”—\nTae’s ears rose in the name. “B-Bogum?” He asked. \n“Bogum brought you home and said that he found you tied on a sledge in the forest. Its been two days already.” His father said.\nTae felt disappointed, because the person he was expecting wasn’t the one who saved him.—\nHe slowly nodded, he can feel his heart fell in pain. Why did he expect too much? He shouldn’t have. \n‘Maybe, he really did not care.’ He thought.\n“Good thing you don’t have any wounds. Don’t worry, I won’t let this slide, I promise to find the person who did this to you.”—\nTae flashed an sly smile. He’s still traumatized, and the pain isn’t helping at all. \n“Come on, I’ve prepared dinner for you.” His mother guided him to stand up. \nEverything was a blur, he’s happy that he’s alive. But he felt sad inside.\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/daa3a910fa1ddc1af8db294ca36dc5b99bbab84d/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f5274664c69715f5270306a7677673d3d2d35302e3136393336343665393662366332363231353539383239373239392e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\" But he felt sad inside\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/c4e57807200ae71d159e38d7ad4c41fe9ddf49ef/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f58395169694b6d77656e6b5661673d3d2d35302e313639333634366564613237613236393939393932303533313633342e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/57476629452b0c832fdecdb27addba973dcaeb77/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f6e45394e625737472d2d4a5973773d3d2d35302e313639333634366636623962346161303834393130343137363137342e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"166\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n<br>166. [ THE NEXT DAY ] \n“Here, give this to Bogum, okay? Make sure he receives it. Also, tell him all my ‘thank you’s okay?” His mom gave him a homemade food inside the topper ware.\n“Yes, I will.” Tae packed it all in his bag and left to go back to the camp.—\nHis parents didn’t actually want to make him go yet, but since being a soldier in their country is a must — they had no choice. \n‘Will I see him there?’ His thoughts we’re scattered, and he hates himself for thinking about Jungkook again. \nHe sighed, its making him insane.—\nRight at the moment he entered the camp, Hoseok ran to hug him. \n“TAEHYUNG-AH YOU’RE BACK!” He cried. His other friends saw him too and hugged him. And now, he’s squeezed. \n“Hey, hey—hold up.” He tapped their shoulder’s and laughed. “I cant breathe.”—\n“Good thing you’re safe! We really missed you here.” Seokjin cried and Tae chuckled. \n“Hey it’s just two days.” They chatted for awhile until Tae remembered something. \n“Where’s Bogum? I need to talk to him.” He asked and they told him that he’s in their room.—\nRight when he arrived in their room, he saw Bogum changing his clothes. He gasped and immediately looked away. \n“Why did you look away? You’re a guy too.” Bogum asked and immediately wore his top. \n“Wait, Taehyung?” He asked and Tae faced him with slight pink face.—\nBogum immediately smiled when he saw Taehyung and couldn’t help but to pull him into a hug. \n“Thank goodness, you’re fine!” Tae was stunned at the movement, and it even made his face heat up even more. \nBogum broke the hug and Tae smiled back. “Yeah, all thanks to you.”—\nTae extended his arm and gave him his mother’s presents. “My mother made that, it’s her thanking gift.” \nBogum on the other hand, felt puzzled. “Thank you, but I can’t accept—“ \n“No, my mother insisted. You should take it. Also, I wanted to thank you for saving me again.”\n"},{"title":"30","data":"—\nBogum shook his head and Tae quickly placed the presents in Bogum’s hand. \n“That’s all yours! And you’re gonna take it whether you like it or not.” Tae flashed his boxy smile. \nBogum looked somewhere else and smiled too. “O-Okay then.”\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/a8d29f87ef63428cafba65e70b2a79910e6c5be5/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f343238794e354d74674c2d2d4b773d3d2d35312e313639333634386634363730663632643135383733343237363433382e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"”\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/278caf5dd1dc4b9e3f871cb4e3617bdb106ab035/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f5265774345537833464b2d584d413d3d2d35312e313639333634386663646631643532313834303830333131323732372e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"169\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n<br>169. \nTheir training for today has finally finished. Tae felt his tiredness but he can cope up with it now since he’s been doing trainings for some weeks. \nSometimes, he would look around &amp; try to see if SOMEONE is looking. \nBut he’s just hurting himself. Jungkook was nowhere.—\nHe suddenly saw Bogum sitting on the bench — staring onto the space. He decided to approach him because he looks out of himself. \n“What are you thinking?” Tae asked, sitting beside him. Bogum flinched at the sudden voice, then sighed. \n“What’s the matter?”—\nBogum was fiddling his fingers. He seems anxious. “Hey, it’s okay. Tell me.” Tae encouraged him. \nHe heard another sigh from him. “Tae...I-I need to tell you something.” Tae felt intrigued. \nIt must be important for him to be this anxious. “What is it?”—\nBogum was hesitating. Tae was curious but he didn’t want to pressure him. \n“I...” he started. “I was just the one who took you home, but I wasn’t the one who saved you.” \nTae felt deaf with his words. He went silent for a second. “Pardon?”— \nBogum faced him, he looks troubled. “Captain Jeon was the one who saved you.” \nTae felt so confused, and hurt at the same time. Is he hearing all of these right? \n“What...? What do you mean—I don’t understand?” He felt nervous and he doesn’t know why.\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/a2a621cacba9f32c6d554f5463fb186490bab7d4/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f4f6d504b323770686f33384663413d3d2d35312e313639333634613962663230613063613234303734393338373333382e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"1096\" data-original-height=\"1920\" alt=\"?

Only the street torches, and crickets we’re accompanying them. \nJungkook has so many much in my mind. He’s carrying the sleeping Taehyung in his arms and he’s glad that he’s asleep. \nHe’s so so worried.—\nHis foot tripped on the side and he almost fell, but his knee supported him and he’s kneeling down. \nBut it wasn’t so fortunate since the knee that was pressed on the ground had a gunshot. \n“Ah...” he groaned, he was shaking. He had so many wounds — his face, arms, &amp; knees.—\nHe sighed and gathered all of his left energy to stand up. \nHis wounds we’re aching, he had two gunshots — on the knee and a graze of the bullet in his arm.\nBut he can’t give up, he has to make sure Taehyung is safe first. \nHe endured the pain until he finally reached —— \nthe camp. The soldiers guarding the camp gate immediately distinguished his face and quickly opened the gate for him. \nLuckily, Bogum was one of the soldiers that were guarding the gate. He immediately called him. \n“Sir! You’re injured, you need to be—“—\n“Get the horse ready, faster.” Bogum quickly ran to the horse’s parking area and grabbed a random horse. \n“Get him up.” Jungkook ordered and Bogum helped him put Tae onto the horse carefully. Bogum was riding the horse too and Tae was leaning on him for support.— \n“Bring him home. Please make sure he returns home safe.” His voice were weak, and he’s panting for breath. \nThe other soldiers called the military doctor. He came and assisted Jungkook. Bogum saluted and was about to leave when Jungkook spoke.—\n“If ever his family asks, tell them you saved him. Tell them you found him tied on a sledge in a forest near a cliff.” \nBogum’s mouth flung open. He doesn’t know why he’s being ordered like that. “B-But Sir, I did not—“ \n“Please, I’m counting on you Mr. Park.”—\nBogum hesitated at first, but he eventually saluted, “Sir, yes sir!” He said and left. \nJungkook was brought onto the clinic, so many groans we’re heard because of the pain of his wounds. \nIt was too much and unbearable. \n“What happened, Captain?” The doctor asked, but ——\nJungkook kept quiet. “You have so many wounds, where did you get this?” But still, no response. \n“I heard you suddenly ran away in the other city. Did you know you’re about to be promoted Major? Lieutenant was gonna surprise you about that but you ran away.”—\nAfter being cured, he went to his office with lots of bandages in his arms and legs. He waited for some minutes and finally, the person he’s been waiting for arrived. \n“Sir,” Bogum saluted and entered his office. “Report.” Jungkook ordered. \n“He’s all fine Sir, I told ——\nthem about what you said. Mr. Kim is still unconscious but I believe he’ll recover soon.” He said. \nJungkook slowly nodded. He finally got to breathe now that he knew Tae was safe. \n“I-If it’s not too much to ask, why did you want me to tell them that I saved him?”—\nJungkook lean onto his chair and thought of an answer without telling him what happened. \n“He hates me,” he started. “He wouldn’t like it if he’ll knew that I was the one who saved him. And please, don’t tell anyone.” \nBogum slowly nodded, and left.[ END OF FLASHBACK ]\n"},{"title":"31","data":"171. \nTae’s tears kept on falling as soon as Bogum told him what happened. \n“I promised Captain that I won’t tell anyone &amp; you but my conscience can’t take it anymore.” \n“He’s the one you should thank. He did not receive his promotion cuz he ran away to save you.”—\nTae covered his mouth as soon as he started to bawl. \nHe doesn’t know what to feel and even what to think. His thoughts were so scattered and his heart was beating so fast. \nIt hurts so much to think that he thought he never cared but it turns our he’s still there.—\n“W-Where is he?” Tae asked, calming himself down. “He’s in his office—“ \nAs soon as that, he immediately stood up and ran away — towards the place where Jungkook is always staying. \nHe bit his lip, trying to to cry again. He doesn’t want him to see that he’s crying.—\nBut as soon as he opened the door, Jungkook was facing his back, and immediately turned when he heard the door opened. \nHis wounds on his face were still visible, his bandage on his arm and elbow are still there. He looks so injured. \nAnd that made Tae burst in tears.—\n“Why are you here? You should be resting—“ \n“Isn’t that what I’m supposed to tell you?” \nJungkook was taken aback by his words. He froze on his place. Tae grabbed the pillow on the side and threw it to Jungkook. \n“I hate you so much!” He cried in anger.—\nJungkook did not respond, he probably deserved this for what he did to him last week. \n“I hate you for still caring, I hate you for saving me, I hate you for messing up with my feelings, I hate you because I still like you even thought you hurt me!”—\nTae did not care about all the words that he just said. He was in rage, he’s furious. But at the same time, his heart was aching. \nHe wanted to shout at him, he wanted to kick him and throw him off a bridge. \nBut seeing Jungkook with all those wounds, made his heart weak.—\nHe immediately went towards his and cupped his face, checking his wounds. \n“Are you okay? Does it still hurt?” Jungkook can feel the coldness and shaking of Tae’s hand. His eyes we’re full of worries. \nHe checked his arm. “Who did this to you? They’re so mean.”—\nHe was speaking in between his cries. He knelt down and lifted the end of Jungkook’s pants a bit to see his knee. \n“You don’t look okay, you have so many wounds—“ Tae was taken aback when he saw Jungkook unconsciously and fondly smiling at him. \nHis heard jumped.—\n“Why are you smiling?! Do you think it’s funny?! I’m worried and you’re just gonna smile?!” Tae angrily said and stood up. \nHe furiously wiped his tears. “You know what? You—“ \n“I’m sorry.” \nHe was cut off by his words. He did not expect him to say that.—\n“I’m sorry for what I did last week. I never meant any of those. I was just really stressed and pressured that day so maybe I vented it on you. I’m really sorry.”\nTae’s heart ached at his words. He really looked sincere. Tae sniffed and gathered himself up.—\n“So...a-are we friends then?” Tae shyly asked. And Jungkook couldn’t control his smile. \n“I always see you as that.” Tae was caught off guard by his words, and immediately smiled when he saw Jungkook smiling. \nThat’s the first time he saw him smile, and he’s beautiful.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/20aa9542198d1038ec76f73ca02c83d2fdf3901a/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f4230655777676450724e6c5278513d3d2d35322e31363933376636643765373161313665353538383336373638362e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"794\" alt=\"That’s the first time he saw him smile, and he’s beautiful\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n173.\nTae felt overwhelmed, he smiled back — but he couldn’t help his tears. \nJungkook was caught off guard when Tae suddenly hugged him. He’s just a bit taller than him. \nJungkook doesn’t know whats happening. Why is his heart beating so fast? It’s just Taehyung?— \nTae started sniffing, indicating that he’s crying. His face was nuzzled onto Jungkook’s shoulders. \n“I’m sorry for doubting you,” Tae paused. “I thought you never cared. I thought I never mean to you. I thought—“\nTae was taken aback when Jungkook hugged back.—\n“You thought what?” Jungkook’s voice was gentle and comforting — like he wanted Tae to be the only one who’ll hear it. \nTae gulped, he’s lost in words. “I thought you won’t come and save me.” He cried. \nJungkook doesn’t know how to respond. Cuz he also, doesn’t ——\nknow why he’s protecting Tae. He’s a Captain, a soldier, and not a butler. \nHe can just leave him alone. He can just disobey the general and do his own job. \nBut there was something in his heart — he felt like he have to protect him. \nHe WANTED to protect him.—\nNo one spoke. They stood in that position for how long? No one knew. \nThey’re just strangers, who felt familiar to each other. And even just in their first touch — they felt safe and comfortable. \n“You said you like me.” Jungkook spoke out of nowhere.—\nTae’s eyes bawled in shock. \nHe immediately broke the hug and took a step backwards away from Jungkook. \n“I said that? No I didn’t.” Tae looked away, trying to avoid eye-contact. He knew he said that, but it was just the flow of emotions.\nAnd now, he’s so screwed.—\n“You said you hate me because even If I had hurt you, you still like me.” \nTae gulped, and Jungkook on the other side is having fun teasing him. \n“I never said something like that. And if I did, I don’t mean it.” \nJungkook nodded. “Really? Too bad, I like you too.”—\nTae’s head shot upright, wide eyes looking at Jungkook. Did he heard that wrong?\n“Sorry what?” He asked, he heard it loud and clear. But what if not? \n“I said I like you too.” Tae was literally frozen on his place. His mind stopped working but his heart is beating so fast.—\nTae didn’t know how to respond. He doesn’t know what to feel. His heart is overjoyed. \nJungkook on the other hand, couldn’t help it anymore. “I’m kidding.” He laughed and Tae felt so disappointed. \nHe grabbed the pillow on his side and threw it to Jungkook.—\n“Ah!” The pillow his his knee and he’s groaning in pain. \nTae stuck his tongue out. “Deserved.” \nHe was about to leave when he saw a familiar letter on top of Jungkook’s table. \nHe went towards it and grabbed it. “What...the fuck.”\n"},{"title":"32","data":"\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/ac43e29d240a05f093b1c6b7affa816708908875/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f593876696465634f4968347832673d3d2d35332e313639333766386231366138646131373131303235343234323338302e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"1920\" data-original-height=\"1920\" alt=\"175\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n175. \nAnd on the other side of his hand was the letter he saw on the sledge. Tae furrowed his brows at the words. \n“Why is this just letters?” He asked, scanning the piece of paper. \n“That’s a code.” Jungkook answered, recovering from his knee pain.—\n“How is this a code?”\n“It’s called ‘Caesar’s Box’. Its used by the Roman Empire. Come here, I’ll teach you.” \nJungkook sat on his chair and pulled out a piece of paper and a fountain pen. \nTae smiled at the pen, he never expected he’d see this kind of pen.—\n“What does this say?” Tae was referring to the code. \n“It says ‘in the forest cliff’.” Tae’s mouth flung open. “How did you read it?” He asked. \nJungkook wrote the letters in a straight line. “If you’ll count the letters, its 16. Get its square root and its 4.”—\nJungkook wrote the word by four letters. “You’ll have to read it column by column.” Tae was amazed by what he just learned. \nSeriously, how genius is Jungkook? \n“You shouldn’t be amazed. Someone sent me this. And up to now, I don’t know why they’ll do that to you.”\n\n                                <img

\n<br>183. \n“Why are you here?” Jungkook asked, not giving a look at Tae. He’s busy reading a book — a philosophy book. \nTae put the aid kit on his table, and it caught Jungkook’s attention. “Why do you have that?” \n“The trainer taught us first aids. So I might wanna try it on you.”—\nJungkook’s wounds are a bit fine now. But the stab on his abdomen is still aching. \nJungkook shook his head. “Mr. Kim, I’m literally wounded—“ \nTae pouted, “I want realistic things. And it’ll train me more. Come on!” He said and opened the kit.—\n“That’s not how it works. Besides, don’t you still have another training—“\n“Its already 6 in the eve and the trainings are done. Just please, please, let me do this? Pleaaaaase?” \nJungkook doesn’t know what to think. How can he reject him when he’s acting cute like that?—\n“Fine.” Jungkook sighed, closing the book he was reading. \nTae felt excited, he had some other mission why he’s here, but he still wanted to try his skills. \nJungkook stood up and started unbuttong his uniform. \n“H-Hey! What the fuck are you doing?!” Tae felt flustered.—\nJungkook on the other hand, was confused. “What? I have a wound in my abdomen. I thought you want realistic things?” He asked. \nTae looked down, trying to his face. “W-Why on your abdomen? You have wounds on your elbow and knees too!—“\n“They’re fine. And this one isn’t.”—\nTae looked away because even right before he stops Jungkook, he had already taken off his top. \n“You don’t have to do anything. Just change the bandage.” Jungkook ordered, putting his top above the chair. \nTae looked for the bandage quietly. His heart is beating so hard.—\nHe finally found the bandage, he started cutting it until Jungkook spoke. \n“Aren’t you supposed to measure my waist first?” He asked, and Tae was caught off guard. \nHe turner around and gulped, seeing Jungkook topless is just...oh my god.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/40a77340ab7d74035fb2e6396e5c191a5e5bb3cd/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f6b495f4b68303469537164795f413d3d2d35332e313639333830303337656664666333313635323333393335393130322e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\"oh my god\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n185. \nTae removed the current bandage encircling his abdomen. And it revealed a long cut, its stitched. \nTae felt a bit worried since Jungkook probably got that while saving him. He felt so bad. \nHe started to encircle a new bandage around his waist.—\n“Your hands are shaking.” Jungkook whispered. \n“No, you’re just seeing things—“ , “Are you flustered?” \nTae let out a loud sarcastic laugh. \n“HA. HA. HA. Flustered? Over you? How pathetic.” He said and turned around, cursing himself mentally.—\nThey went silent for awhile, Tae was starting to focus on cutting the bandage, and Jungkook was just observing him. \n“Captain,” Tae called. “Did you get these wounds in the forest?” He asked, cuz he’s really curious. \nJungkook hesitated, but he eventually spoke, “Yes.”—\n“There are lots of traps. I avoided some but not all. The one who set you up is really good.” He said. \nTae successfully wrapped the bandage around his wound. “There, it’s done! See? I’m good at this!” Tae giggled. \nHe was fixing the kit when sum1 knocked on the door.—\n“Come in,” Jungkook said while putting his top on.\nThe person opened the door — and its Dongjin — that guy who got involved in a suicide case last week. But he was proven innocent. \nAnd now, he looks pale and thinner. “Good evening, sir.” He saluted.—\n“May I talk to Mr. Kim?” He asked and that caught Tae’s attention. “M-me?” He asked. \nDongjin nodded, “If it’s okay.” Tae was hesitating. He immediately looked at Jungkook and he was also looking at him. \nBut his eyes, were giving him assurance.—\nLike his eyes we’re telling him that he shouldn’t be scared because he’s there. And its just the eyes, but they understood each other. \nTae nodded and went outside with Dongjin. It really looks like its a serious one. \n“What do you want to talk about with me?” He asked.—\nDongjin was fidgeting with his fingers, he’s hesitating and he looks anxious. Tae felt even more nervous.\n“Hey, it’s okay. I’ll listen.” He gave him a smile to make him comfortable, but it didn’t look like it helped. \n“Taehyung, I’m sorry...”—\nHe was crying, and he’s shaking. Tae panicked because he doesn’t know why he’s crying. \n“W-Why are you sorry? Its not like you—“ \n“I was the one who hit you that day.” \nTae’s mouth was open, but no words left it. He can’t believe what he’s hearing right now.—\n“That day when you we’re getting your bag in your room. I was the one who hit you.” He cried, and he’s shaking even more. \nTae was lost in thoughts. “Why...would you do that?” His voice tone feeling betrayed. \n“I helped you in your case &amp; thats what you’re gonna do to me?”—\nDongjin shook his head and held Tae’s hand, like he’s begging for forgiveness. \n“No, no, Its not like that. I’m so sorry I never wanted to do that. I spent nights being attacked by my conscience and I can’t fight it anymore. Please, I’m so sorry.” \nTae felt confused.—\n“Who asked you to do that?” He asked, making Dongjin freeze.\nHe looks like he’s thinking, then he spoke. “I don’t know who he is since he’s not the one who asked me. But I heard his name is—“ \nTae flinched and let out a loud gasp. He felt so shocked of what he just saw.\n"},{"title":"33","data":"❗️WARNING ❗️\n- mention of blood<br>- please skip the next thread if you’re sensitive with this topic—\n“Oh my god...” he stepped back with his hands covering his mouth. And since Jungkook was listening through the door, he immediately went out to see what was happening. \nDongjin was lying on the ground, eyes shot open due to shock, and his blood is dripping out of his head.—\nJungkook immediately ran to Tae and pulled him inside his office. \nTae wasn’t that sensitive to blood, but seeing someone die in front of you is another topic.\nHe’s shaking in fear, and his fear turned into tears. “Just stay here okay? Don’t go out until I told you so.”—\nJungkook ordered, he took a last glimpse of Tae before going outside. \nHe called some soldiers to get the corpse and clean the blood on the floor. He ordered the others to inspect the whole camp and every soldier. \nThey have guns, but the culprit used a silencer since ——\nthey heard no sound of gunshot. \nIts already 6:30 and he gathered up all the soldiers in the field, all of them looks confused about the sudden meeting.\nBut no one had a silencer. \nJungkook spoke his notes and dismissed them. He immediately went to Taehyung.—\nHe’s sitting in the corner, hugging a pillow. And he’s fast asleep. \nJungkook heaved a sigh. He somehow felt relieved despite of what happened earlier, knowing that Tae is all safe. \nHe slowly knelt down, and observed his features.—\nHe looks all strong and bubbly when he’s awake. He’s really stubborn and noisy. But seeing him in this state where he’s asleep? Jungkook’s mind changed. \nAfter all what happened, he realized that there’s a man who freely expresses himself. No masculinity rules, just ——\nbeing himself. Every men that he met is acting all masculine, stern and intimidating — because at this time — men’s masculine personality is a must. \nBut Taehyung, he’s beautifully different. \nAnd Jungkook can’t help but to smile at him.—\nMaybe, maybe that’s one of the reasons why he wanted to protect him. \nHe’s too precious to sacrifice. \n“I promise,” he started with his gentle voice, not wanting to wake him up. \n“I promise I’ll protect you at all cost. Even if that cost, is my life.”186. \n“Good morning.” Tae stretched his arms, rubbing eyes to fully adjust to the light. “Morning.” \nHe greeted back. Unfamiliar things welcomed him once he opened his eyes. \nThis isn’t their room. \nHe sat bolt upright, eyes widened at the person before him.—\n“OH MY GOD?!” He immediately covered his body like he’s naked, and Jungkook just raised an eyebrow. \n“DID YOU DO SOMETHING TO ME?” He cried, trying to remember what happened last night. \n“I just carried you on the bed, nothing more.” Jungkook said innocently.—\nHe’s still in his office, and he probably slept here. That’s embarrassing. \nBut there’s only one bed, “Where did you sleep?” He asked, grabbing the kit. \n“Chair. Long chair.” Tae bit his lip. He felt bad since Jungkook probably didn’t sleep well.\n—\nHe fixed his hair and stood up, “Thank you.” He bowed and was about to leave when he remembered something. \n“H-Hey, about the guy—“ Jungkook cut him off. “I took care of it, don’t worry.” \nHe have him an assuring smile, and Tae left.\n\n      <img

He’s in their house — specifically in his bedroom, observing the notebook. \nHe quickly hid the notebook inside his bag &amp; took his way towards the office, hiding behind the walls to see what’s happening.—\n“I believe, this isn’t your worst.” His father stated. \nHis heart ached when he saw yoongi almost lying onto the floor. His face had bruises, and its surely from a punch. \n“I can’t believe I let you live in my house—“ , “Dad, enough!” Tae meddled, even before another punch.—\nHis dad took back his arm, fixing his clothes and acting like nothing happened. “Fix your mess, Yoongi.” And left. \nTae immediately guided Yoongi to stand up, then sat on the couch. “You don’t seem okay, hyung.”\n“I’m fine. His hits are getting weaker. He’s indeed aging.”—\nTae didn’t know what to say. Does that mean Yoongi always gets beaten up? \n“May I ask what happened?” He asked while looking for the aid kit. “Nothing much. I just messed up some files he asked me too.” \nTae sat beside him, quickly taking out some medicines.—\n“Just because of that? He would beat his own son?” He asked, damping the cloth with medicine onto his wounds. \n“Taehyung, do you not remember? I’m not his son.” \nTae paused at what he heard. He was frozen. Because he know he’ll be suspicious when he’ll react surprised.—\n“I-I forgot,” he excused, and continued curing his wounds. \nYoongi sighed. “I’m mother’s son even before they got married and had kids. Mom knew that he doesn’t treat me like his son but she doesn’t know that he beats me up.” \nTae felt pissed, “What? You never told mom?”—\n“You should tell her! How long had dad been beating you up? She has to know this—“ Yoongi grabbed his wrist and slowly pulled him down on the seat. \n“Please, don’t tell her. Because I know that she won’t hesitate to divorce with your dad. That will be a big trouble.”—\nYoongi said with pleading eyes, and Tae felt nothing but anger and pity. \nHe’s willing to endure all the pain just for the family that he’s just a half part of. Its obvious that he’s being beaten up since ages, but he decided not to speak up for the fear of breaking a family.—\nTae had no choice but to obey him. He wanted to help him, but being quiet is the least he can do for now. \nTae noticed that Yoongi was impishly smiling. “What’s to smile at?” He asked. How can he still smile in the midst of a problem?—\n“I’m just happy that you’re caring for me again now.” He started. \n“We used to be so close when we’re kids. Jennie even asked for a younger sister because she can’t keep up with us. But when you reached 18, you became distant to me. That’s maybe because father told you so.”—\nTo be honest, its hard to keep up with something you have no clue about. \nThis family is a big mystery. Was the real Taehyung that scary? Is he all poised and intimidating?\nIf he is, then the change is obvious. Because Tae aren’t any of those.—\n“I...I just realized nothing will happen if I keep being distant. After all, we’re a family right?” Tae flashed his boxy smile to try and lighten up the mood. \nAnd he succeeded, he painted a smile on Yoongi’s face. \n“What are you talking about?”<br>—\nThe both flinched at the sudden voice behind them. It was Jennie, arms across her chest and she’s giving them a suspicious look. \n“It’s a guy talk. Are you a guy?” Tae teased, and Jennie gave her a glare. \n“You, you, you both. If I’ll become a guy I’ll beat you up.”—\nShe said and left. “She really has an attitude, does she?” Yoongi chuckled. \n“What is—AH!” He cried when Tae pressed a bit hard on his wound. “Oops! Sorry.” He said and carefully did it again.\nWith that little time of talk, he’s growing more suspicion with his father.\n\n      <img

\n"},{"title":"36","data":"209. \n“What is it?” Jungkook asked, not throwing off a gaze at Taehyung who just got in his office. He’s busy typing on a typewriter. \n“You’re still working? Come on, its a holiday!” Tae exclaimed, lowkey putting the purple notebook in the shelf. \nGood thing he didn’t notice.—\n“Leisures will just waste my time. I chose to be a soldier to take care of our country, not to wander around.” \nTae rolled his eyes, he appreciates his love for their country but can he not take a break for awhile? \n“I know, but can you rest for awhile? Have fun?”—\nJungkook did not answer. His brows were furrowed and all focused to what he’s doing. \nTae went to see what he’s typing. And he was just amazed on how he continuously types without any mistakes. \nA typewriter is something like a computer. But once you typed something wrong ——\nyou need to repeat everything from the top.\nAnd maybe, Tae would now prefer a typewriter than a simple laptop. Because it enhances skills, and protects your eye from radiation. \n“Just state why you’re here.” Jungkook said.—\n“I just want you to go with me in the central. I’m certain that it’s a festival aura there!” Tae tried to sound a bit exciting, hoping that he’ll enthuse him. \n“I’m sorry, I can’t. You can go by yourself or with your friends. I really need to finish this.”—\nTae pouted and gave him a judging glare. “You can save that for tomorrow, it’s a holiday! They’ll understand. Just please, please go with me...” \nTae tried his best to show all his cuteness just to pursue Jungkook. \nBut as they say, his best wasn’t enough.—\n“Mr. Kim, I apologize but no. Should I call my staff to accompany you?” He asked. \nTae sighed, giving up. “No, thank you.” He said with a heavy heart and went out of the office. \nJust in time, Bogum passed by with Namjoon and their team.—\n“Hey, Tae! What’s with the long face?” Namjoon greeted &amp; Tae immediately shook his head &amp; smiled. \n“Nothing! Where r u guys going?” Tae asked. “We’re apparently going to the central to join the celebration. Wanna come with us?” \nTae nodded. “Yes! I-“ \n“He’s going with me.”—\nJungkook suddenly came out of his office, and Tae was never been so confused. \n“You can come with us too, Captain!” Bogum said and Jungkook shook his head. \n“No, it’s just us.” Tae raised his brows. “You said you can’t—“ \n“Shall we go, Mr. Kim?”—\nBogum was about to speak again when Hoseok did. “It’s okay Bogum, let’s just meet Tae later, hehe. Take care Tae!” \nHe pulled Bogum and left. \nTae faced Jungkook with a questioning face. “You said you’re busy.” \nJungkook shook his head. “I said that? I didn’t.”\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/a123c3a9470c42c689af1ce3e03dfd1557d36d08/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f727765324e616d4a78366d7372673d3d2d35372e3136393338313338353561656139393638343632323731363434352e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"211\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n211. \nTae was was so excited. And the festival aura in the central is making him more excited. \nIts been so many years since he’s been in an arcade, and he’ll love to see it again. Even if its a different era. \n“Mr. Kim,” Jungkook called. “We can’t go out like this.”—\nTae paused, looking at him in confusion. They’re in the middle of the way, it was loud and full of music — its a holiday eh?\n“Huh?” He asked. Jungkook pointed at his clothes. \n“It’s okay for you to roam around with that uniform since ur still a trainee,”—\n“But not for me, I’m wearing a Captain uniform. I have a position and I think that’ll sound disrespectful.” \nHe said, and Tae thought for a while. “Its okay! I’ll buy you some clothes. You can change in the rest rooms.” \nSuddenly, a fuss caught their attention.—\nThey immediately went in between the walls of the houses since it is where the fuss came from. \n“Excuse me,” Jungkook said while diving in the crowd. \nOnce they got in, they saw a pregnant woman who is already in labor. \n“Where’s the midwife?” A random person asked.—\n“She’s on her way, but I think it’ll take time for her to come here.” \nThe woman was crying in pain, and the women beside her were just trying to distract her on the pain. \nJungkook was hesitating, but he eventually spoke. “I’ll replace the midwife for now.”—\nPeople around them we’re shocked. They were whispering and kept making sounds. \nFor Tae, it was just normal for him to see soldiers voluntarily becoming midwives. But he forgot that he’s in 1894. \n“Captain, are you sure about this?” He asked.—\n“Don’t worry, I studied primary health care, I know what I’m doing. Besides, the baby’s coming out soon.” \nThe woman cried in pain. Jungkook quickly positioned himself. “Breathe in, breathe out. Now push!” \nThe woman did as what she’s told, her face is already red in pain.—\n“Just a little more, you can do it!” Jungkook’s already holding the baby but it’s still not fully out. \nIt was a series of cries and shouts until they finally heard a baby’s cry. \nThe people around clapped and cheered, it was new for them to see a guy doing a midwife’s job.—\nAnd Tae on the other hand, felt like crying. Not just because of what Jungkook did but because of the new life that was introduced to the world. \nThe woman looks so tired and in pain but right after Jungkook handed him the baby in a blanket, she still got to smile.—\nAnd that’s where his heart ached. \nHe would never understand a mother’s love since he doesn’t remember being a newborn. \nBut seeing how the woman was crying in joy while caressing her baby was more than enough for him to understand. \nA mother’s love indeed.—\nThe midwife came and the only job she did was take care of the woman and the baby. \nThe woman and every people around that time thanked Jungkook. And Captain could never be happier knowing that he saved and helped a life. \n“You’re amazing.” Tae cried.—\n“So, I really need to change. I have blood all over my cloth.” Jungkook said and Tae immediately went out to buy some clothes. \nHe handed it to him and waited for him to come out from changing. \nAnd Tae doesn’t know what to feel when he finally saw Jungkook.\n"},{"title":"37","data":"—\nIn a simple hanbok, like those other normal people wears. \nHe looks so normal. So damn normal to the point that he looks unreal. How can someone look like this? And he’s not even trying? \n“Sha’ll we go?” Jungkook asked and Tae was out of his thoughts. \n“Yes! Sure.”\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/20df71657aa0a17a51451127a15aec8e034d38ea/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f4a5a5543574145524f68615136513d3d2d35382e313639333831353735373036633863373639353435383038353736322e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\"”\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/614d666bec99789b24a11e6daae20d7db73e62c9/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f79684f6172324a6d61676a724b773d3d2d35382e313639333831353765303666656161613532393635333432343730312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"213\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n<br>213. \n“Let’s ride that! Oh my god!” Tae cried like a 4 year old. \nThey’re currently in the arcades and it’s quite big. There are so many people and Tae has never felt such holiday spirit. \n“A carousel? But those are just for kids...” \nTae raised a brow at him.—\n“Excuse me? Do you see any age requirements? Arcades aren’t just for kids!” \n“But also for people who think like kids?” \nTae smacked him in the arm and that made Jungkook laugh. For the first time in fucking ever. \nHe did not just smirk — he fucking laughed.—\nTae was astonished at what he just saw. His jaw literally dropped, and the sound kept ringing through his ears. \n“C-Can you do that again?” He asked, &amp; Jungkook immediately fixed his expression. \n“I thought we’re gonna ride the carousel?” Tae’s face immediately lit up.—\nPulled by arm, there are still some empty slots on the carousel since its quite big so they won’t have the need to fall in line. \nMaybe, just fall in love? \n“Here?” Jungkook asked when Tae pointed a horse. He’s new to this coz he never went to the arcades when he’s little.—\nTae wanted to ride too, but his naughty side was ruling over him. \nOnce Jungkook has rode a horse, he quickly hopped off the carousel and it started to spin. \n“Yah!” Jungkook cried when he realized what’s happening.—\nTae was laughing hard while watching Jungkook ride with the kids on the carousel. \nHe looked like an innocent kid who looks so lost. Tae quickly took out his phone and took a picture of Jungkook who’s looking so betrayed. \nHe looked at the photo and laughed again.—\nThe ride had finished, but Tae hasn’t stopped laughing yet. \nJungkook walked towards him with a deadly glare, the once doe eyes we’re now looking like a tiger’s. \n“How dare you?” He cried, and Tae was in tears. \n“I’m sorry, you looked funny.” Jungkook rolled his eyes.—\n“I don’t find it funny.” He crossed his arms across his chest. \n“Just look at you,” Tae showed him his photo on his phone. “You look like ur about to throw tantrums!” \nAnd Tae started laughing again. People around them are now looking at him, maybe thinking he’s possessed.—\nBut Jungkook on the other hand, looked nothing but confused. \nHe can’t believe he’s seeing himself on a not so big frame. He grabbed the phone and he confirmed that it’s not a paper. \n“What is this object?” He asked, flipping it on sides to inspect it.—\nTae realized what’s happening. He forgot that cellphones aren’t still present here. \nHe must be culture-shocked. \n“It’s called a cellphone.” Tae explained while Jungkook was busy inspecting it. \n“Ce-ll...ce...cell...phone...cellp-phone?”—\nTae nodded. “You use it to send messages to your loved ones, and also take photos.” \nJungkook looked at him in confusion. “Photos?” He asked. \n“Isn’t this a daguerreotype?” \nAnd this time, it was Tae’s brows who furrowed. “A what?”—\n“A daguerreotype. It’s also used to take photos. But its not like this, this is too small and...way too advance.” \nTae’s mouth flung open, he learned something new today. “Where did you get this?” \nTae doesn’t know how to answer that. How is he gonna explain?—\nTae immediately grabbed his phone and put it back in his pocket. \n“What’s our next ride?” He changed the topic. He’s not good at words and Jungkook might misinterpret him if he ever try to make excuses. \nAnd atleast, he didn’t ask anymore.—\nThey dragged each other on places. Left, right, north, south — Jungkook is starting to be a bit loose and bubbly. \nThey rode all the rides they wanted to, and because of that tiredness, they got hungry. \n“I’m hungry, let’s eat first!” Tae said and Jungkook agreed.\n—\nThey ate at a random eatery. The food looks nice and there are lots of people so they’re supposing that the food tastes good. \nThey ordered their foods and Tae was gonna pay but Jungkook insisted. \n“You paid for my clothes awhile ago, let me pay this time.”—\nWhile eating, Tae suddenly got curious. “Captain,” he called. \n“Hm?” Jungkook hummed, chewing the food in his mouth. \n“Were you jealous?” Jungkook suddenly paused, he shot his head up to look at Tae. \nHe raised his brows, trying to ask what he just said.—\n“Awhile ago. Were you jealous because Bogum asked me to go out with them?” \nJungkook drank water to push down the food. “Why would I be jealous?” \nIts just a simple question, but Tae doesn’t know how to answer. “U-uhm...” \n“He’s just your friend, right?”—\nTae’s mouth flung open. With that question, he decided to do something. \nTae bit his lip and smiled. “Well yes! He’s my friend but...” Hearing the ‘but’ in the end made Jungkook raise his brows. \n“He’s really handsome. He looks approachable and cute! ——\nHis eyes shine when he smile and have you seen his gummy smile? It’s really charming!” \nTae stopped talking when he noticed Jungkook harshly chopping the meat off. \nHe giggled, “Are you okay? What has the meat done to you?” \n“Nothing, it’s just really hard to chop off.”—\nBut the funny thing is, the meat isn’t hard at all. \nTae just laughed to himself and continued to eat his meal. \nOnce they’re done, they just took a little rest and started wandering &amp; riding rides again. \nBut this time, it’s Jungkook’s turn to choose rides.—\n“I wan’t to try that one.” Jungkook pointed up — right on the ferris wheel. \nTae gulped at the sight. “O-Oh, that.” He’s cursing himself for stuttering. \n“Okay, let’s go!” He said and they immediately went towards it to fall in line.—\nWhile on the line, Tae was quiet &amp; Jungkook could sense that there’s something odd. \n“Are you okay?” He asked, and Tae scratched his head. “W-Well, I’m kinda nervous since it’s high. You know...I’m afraid of heights.” \n“Okay then, let’s just ride another—“—\n“No! It’s okay. I wanted to try this too. It’s just that I’m nervous.” \nHe was surprised when Jungkook held his cold and sweaty hands. \n“Look at me, just me.” \nAt those words, Tae doesn’t know what to feel anymore. His feelings we’re a mess &amp; Jungkook was making it harder.—\nThey’re finally cupped in the seats of the ferris wheel. \nBut it was a lot different since the modern ferris wheel was closed and caged, this one is all open — and it’s just the seats &amp; safety rails. \nThe ferris wheel started to spin and Tae flinched at the sudden movement.—\n“Oh god, that’s so high.” Tae was shaking but not that bad. \n“Didn’t I told you look just at me?” Jungkook said and Tae’s heart was wilding again. \n“Nothing bad will happen, and I won’t let it happen. Just take a close your eyes, take a deep breathe and you’ll see.”—\nTae bit his lip. He’ll lose nothing if he’ll try right? \nHe closed his eyes, took a deep breathe and tried to relax. The ferris wheel was moving not so fast but also not so slow, and it’s helping Tae relax. \nHe slowly opened his eyes and was never been amazed of what he saw.—\nRight before his eyes, was the breathtaking view of their province. \nThere are no tall buildings, no wide constructed roads, no cars and horns, no smoke and pollution — just the people peacefully having fun, natural lights and nature was clearly seen. \nTae felt so sad.—\nIf only the future saw this, if only the future realized how beautiful this is, if only the future took care of nature...\nThen he wouldn’t have been regretting not participating in nature related activities. \nHe wouldn’t have been this sad &amp; feeling sorry for the nature.\n"},{"title":"38","data":"—\nAnd now, he’s promising himself that once he comes back in the future, he’ll make sure to do everything to preserve nature. \nHe promised. \nTae looked to his side, and just as how sad he is awhile ago, was the same amount of happiness he felt while looking at Jungkook.—\nHe was smiling with his eyes, and his lips painted at beautiful smile on his face. He was looking at the view, and he really looks happy. \nWithin a split second, Tae leaned forward and gave him a quick peck on the cheek. \nJungkook was surprised, but Tae was even surprised.—\n“I-I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean to do that. It just became automatic for me to that when I’m happy or excited and you really looked cute today! I-I’m happy that you’re smiling and I just hope you often—“ \nJungkook cut his words — not by words too — but by his lips.—\nTae paused at his moment of shock. There was that electrifying feeling that he never felt before, &amp; it tingles his stomach like there are butterflies on it. \nSoon after, he found himself responding on the kiss. \nLips on sync, dancing with glory, its wrong but it felt right.—\nTae felt like crying. He’s overwhelmed at the pleasure, his thoughts we’re scattered and all he’s thinking of was how their lips moved in chorus like theyve memorized each other. \nAnd it never felt so wonderful. \nNo one when they’ll stop, or if they would even want to stop.—\nThey parted their lips, leaning onto each other’s forehead while gasping for breathe. \nTheir heartbeats were ringing through their ears. “C-Captain—“ \n“It’s just the two of us, so it’s Jungkook.” \nTae felt his heart jump, &amp; w/o any hesitation, he aimed for his lips again.—\nBut at this time, there are no boundaries, no formalities, no hesitations and questions. No rules, no right or wrong. \nJust two souls, slowly finding their way into each other’s heart.<br>214. \nWalking along the crowd, these two had finally got tired on riding every rides and trying every games. \nJungkook looked at Tae from behind since he was in front, hastening his steps. \nHe can’t help but to smile at how quiet he is right now. \n“Why are you so quiet?”— \nJungkook asked. After what happened in the ferris wheel, their faces were both red and their hearts were beating so loud. \nBut Tae is redder and looks shy after that. And Jungkook thought its cute. \n“H-huh? I’m not.” Tae can’t even look at him in the eye.— \n“You are. You we’re so loud awhile ago and now you’re suddenly quiet.” He said, hands behind his back while walking. \n“Are you still thinking about the k—“ Tae immediately smacked him. “Shut it!” And he saw how red his face is. \nJungkook laughed. He already knew the answer.—\nNot much far from them, we’re two little kids — probably on their sevens — and they can hear their conversation. \n“But Minnie, I’m still hungry.” cried the little guy while sadly eyeing on the small piece of dumpling. \n“Me too Tae, but we need to share w/our families!”— \nThe little kid sighed and pouted, “If I we’re richer, I would buy many dumplings!” He exclaimed. \nJungkook was confused on why Tae stopped walking, and he was looking at the two kids from afar. \nHe quickly took a glance at his face and his eyes we’re glistening. \n“U okay?”—\nTae got caught off guard and immediately wiped his tears. “Y-Yes. I just remembered s-someone.” \nTae glanced at the eatery beside them and their specialty are dumplings. He quickly ordered. \n“Can I have two boxes of dumplings? Regular flavor.”— \nHe waited for his order to be served and once its done, he immediately went to the two kids who’s carefully wrapping up the piece of dumpling. \n“Hi!” Tae greeted and the kids were surprised. The other one hid behind his friend. \n“Oh, hey I-I didn’t mean to scare you.”—\nTae crouched at their level, he placed the two boxes of dumplings in front of them. \n“I overheard your conversation about the food, so I thought of buying you some.” He gently said and smiled. \nThe two kids we’re just looking at him with fear in their eyes.—\n“S-Sir, we don’t have money.” The other one said. \n“Oh, no! You don’t have to pay me. I just really want to help the two of you. So take it, and share it with your families.” \nThe two kids hesitated at first, but they eventually pulled the boxes and checked it.—\nTae felt happy when he saw the kids’ eyes sparkling in happiness when they saw the dumplings. \n“Minnie, it looks delicious!” The other one whispered. \n“D-Does this have a poison?” The other one asked, and Tae’s mouth flung open. \n“P-Poison? No! Why would I do that?”—\n“T-There are people who gets killed because they ate poison. I don’t like poison.” He said and Tae felt a bit hurt. \nHe didn’t know how much kids are open to the world, and they knew how cruel it is. \nTae sighed, and thought of an idea. “Is it okay if I take a bite?”—\nThe kids nodded, and he immediately grabbed a dumpling and took a bite on it. \nHe wanted to prove them that I has no poison. “It’s really delicious! You see? There’s no poison.” He said. \nThe other kid quickly grabbed a dumpling and took a bite. “Mhm! Its delicious!”—\nAnd Tae felt happy when the other also took a bite. “Yes, it is.” \n“Now do you believe me?” Tae asked and the kids nodded. “Listen....” \n“Not everyone are as bad as you think. There’s still good people in this world. You just need to trust them, but don’t let them fool you.”—\nHe was surprised when the other kid hugged him. “Thank you so much, sir!” \nHis heart jumped. It feels so wonderful to be hugged by such kids. The other one joined the hugged too, &amp; now he’s happier. “Thank you too, Sir!” \nHe hugged them back with a big smile on his face.—\n“What are your names?” They broke the hug. \n“My name is Minhyuk!”\n“I’m Taehyeol!” \n“Oh Taehyeol, we have the same first name. I’m Taehyung.” \nThey chatted for a bit and the kids had finally went off with their boxes of dumplings.<br>—\nTae stood up, his heart was feeling heavy awhile ago because he remembered Jimin. \nThey we’re like that too. Jimin always used to tell him to share and be generous &amp; all the kindess in the world. \nHe misses him so much. \nBut it was a bit lighter now since he knew he helped.—\nHe looked back, only to see Jungkook standing alone — and smiling so fondly at him. \nWith their eyes meeting, his heart did a thing — and he can’t help but remember the kiss again. \nHe quickly looked away and panicked a bit when he’s walking towards him.—\n“That was so nice of you.” Jungkook complimented, and up to now, Tae couldn’t still look at him the eye. \n“Thanks.” He said. “Taehyung...” \nHis heart flipped. It was the first time he called him by his name, and it sounds wonderful. \n“Do you trust me?”—\nTae paused. Does he trust him? Should he trust him? \nFor fucks sake — he knew that the moment he met him, he already trusted himself with him. Especially his heart. \n“Of course.” Jungkook held his hand and pulled him onto the horse. They mounted it and went on their way.— \nTae didn’t ask where they we’re going, he trusts him. \nThey went onto an unknown road — there are lots of tress so he’s supposing that they’re somewhat in a forest. \nNot long after, they finally reached their destination. But it was still vague for Tae.—\n“Where are we?” He asked. Jungkook just stood silent and held his hand. \nHe guided him towards a way where a lot of branches we’re blocking. “What are you doing? Isn’t this a dead end—“ \nWith another parting of branches, Tae finally saw nothing but a breathtaking sight.\n"},{"title":"39","data":"— \nTae didn’t ask where they we’re going, he trusts him. \nThey went onto an unknown road — there are lots of tress so he’s supposing that they’re somewhat in a forest. \nNot long after, they finally reached their destination.

Isn’t this a dead end—“ \nWith another parting of branches, Tae finally saw nothing but a breathtaking sight.—\nThey we’re above a cliff, and the view was just beyond ethereal. \n“Wow.” Tae whispered while exploring his gaze down the land, it was really high — but it was enough to see the beauty under it. \nNot city lights, but torches, dancing people, and banderitas.—\nHe saw this before in the ferris wheel, but it was a clearer view here. \n“This is so good.” Tae said while smiling at the view. He was scared of heights, but the beauty was distracting him. \nJungkook laid on the ground beside him. “Lay here.” He patted the side beside him.—\nAnd Tae did was what he was told. \nBut the next few wasn’t quite fine. There was silence between them, and its making him deaf. \n“Remember that time when I told you that I like you?” Jungkook started, eyes shot up on the stars. \n“Yes, you said you’re kidding—“ \n“I wasn’t.”—\nTae literally froze on his place, even his mind stopped working. But he can hear his fucking heartbeat beating through his ears. \nHe was so silent, but he’s screaming inside. \n“I really liked you,” Jungkook said. “But I was confused back then because—“ \nTae cut him off.—\n“—Because a guy shouldn’t be falling for another guy? Is that it?” \nTae felt hurt, but he knew that in this era, his sexuality isn’t acknowledged. \n“Well, yes. The feeling was quite new for me.” Jungkook said. \n“Are you gay?” Tae asked, and Jungkook’s brows furrowed.—\n“What’s a gay?” He asked and Tae chuckled. “That’s a sexuality. That means, you only like men and not women.” \nJungkook tried to process information. “How about if you like both genders?” \n“Then it’s called bisexual.” Jungkook’s brows met, its all new words for him.—\n“Which are you?” Jungkook asked. ”I’m gay.” Tae proudly said. All lgbt+ people are valid and should be respected. \n“Then I’m gay too.” Tae laughed. “What’s funny?” He doesn’t know either. \nMaybe, its how Jungkook said even though he still have no ideas about it.—\nTae gasped. “That’s a shooting star!” He pointed at the light passing above. \n“It’s a meteorite, but people call it shooting star.” Jungkook chuckled, “What’s your wish?” \nTae paused on the question. He has so many wishes.—\nGucci bags, branded clothes, expensive jewelries, and to be a successful fashion designer.\nBut there are no such things like that here, and he don’t want them anymore. \nBecause he had one wish. \n“I wish for you to live longer...and stay with me.”—\nTae gulped because he’s feeling the lump in his throat again. He don’t wanna cry, not for now. \n“You? What’s ur wish?” He asked &amp; looked at him, only to see that he’s looking at him too. \n“I wish for your wish to come true.” Tae broke into a smile, but his heart was aching.—\nIf only Jungkook knew what the future has for him. If only Jungkook knew his fate. If only he does... \nIts making Tae frustrated just thinking about it, and he doesn’t want to be because he knew he can do nothing. \nInstead, he admired the beauty of the night.— \nFor Jungkook, this was the most beautiful view for him back them. He used to go up here too, and watch his people live in peace. \nThe most wonderful environment they say, is when the king worries for its people, and the people doesn’t worry for the king.—\nBut right now, seeing Taehyung with a smile on his face — and that he’s with him and all safe... \nIts the most beautiful view for him. \nAnd that’s the view he’d choose over anything else.\n\n      <img

them. They knew how mad he can get so they try not to bring that side of him. \n“Goodmorning, Captain!”—\nJungkook nodded, acknowledging them. They were used to him doing that, he never greets them. \nBut today is a different one. “Good morning, are you all doing well in your trainings?” \nThe soldiers were frozen. They’re speechless. Did they hear it right? He greeted them back?—\n“S-Sir, yes sir!” They saluted and Jungkook nodded. He left with a big smile on his face. \n“H-hey, i-is that really Captain?” \n“I don’t know either, did he just greet us and smiled?” \n“I think he’s possessed.”\nThe soldiers whispered, it was a new encounter to them.—\nJungkook went to the other side of the field to see SOMEONE. \nIts been a month and a week, just a few more days and the training is over. \nHe saw Tae having a sparring practice with some of his teammates. He has improved in the past few weeks.—\nIts finally their water break. Jungkook had just finished his inspection in the other camp and now he has nothing to do but supervise the trainees. \nTae still hasn’t noticed his presence. He’s busy wiping his sweat and drinking water. \n“You’re good at sparring.”—\nTae flinched when Jungkook went towards him. He immediately fixed himself because he knew he looked like shit. \n“Me? No.” Tae said and fixed his hair. “Since when did you learn to fix your hair?” \nTae raised a brow. “What? Is it bad that I wanted to look good?”—\n“If its for me then you don’t have to. You’re already gorgeous.” Jungkook commented &amp; Tae immediately looked away. \nHe’s flustered again.\n“Times up! Gather back around.” The trainer exclaimed and the soldiers went back. \nJungkook came to the trainer and whispered something.—\nThe trainer announced something after that. “Okay everyone, let’s have another set of sparring. But this time, Captain Jeon is your match.” \nThe soldiers made a fuss. They were quite nervous since they knew how Captain was good at this. \n“Who wants to go first?”—\n“I’ll go!” Bogum raised his hand and the other soldiers were now admiring him for his courage. \nJungkook did not show any emotions. He was gonna choose Tae but he had no choice now. \n“This is just a friendly match to test your skills! No hard feelings!”—\nThe others were on the side, while Jungkook and Bogum were in the center. \nTae felt a bit nervous and doesn’t know if he should be. Jungkook is obviously jealous over Bogum, and that made Tae worried. \n“I just hope they won’t do anything serious.”—\nThe match started. It was all twist and turns. It was also getting a bit tensed. \nBogum got an advantage, with a quick grab in the arm — he immediately took Jungkook down. \nThe crowd were surprised and started cheering for them. \nBut the match isn’t over yet.—\nJungkook stoop up and took of his top since its getting sweaty. \nThe crowd went louder and Tae can’t help but to feel his heart beating faster again. \nBogum took off his top too and Jungkook smirked. \n“Do you like Taehyung?” Jungkook asked out of nowhere.—\nOnly the two of them can hear their conversation. \nThe match started again, it was all grabbing and twisting. It looked painful but for Jungkook — ha, its just nothing. \nHe’s been fighting for years, whats to be in pain now? \nBogum locked him in the neck. “Well do you?”—\nJungkook quickly got to escape his grip and now, they exchanged positions. \nHe’s now the one arm-locking Bogum. It was surprising since he was fast. \n“Since when did a question became an answer?” \nBogum chuckled. “Just now.”—\nBogum didn’t care if he’s already talking to him informally, its just a friendly match with a “friendly” talk — is it? \n“What if I do like him?” Bogum grabbed his arm and twisted it. \nJungkook felt a bit of pain since its an attack on the nerves, but he’s quick and smart.<br>—\n“Sorry to blow it off but I don’t think you have any chance now.” \nHe used Bogum’s gripped &amp; pulled him upwards. But he had nice reflexes and landed on the ground good. \nHe dared to give him a high-kick but Jungkook was quick and grabbed his leg and threw him on the ground.—\n“Times up!” The trainer said and both were panting for breathe. The crowd gave an applause. \nJungkook extended his arm to Bogum. “Nice match, Captain.” Bogum said and stood up. \nThey proceeded onto the next set of training but instead, Tae came to Jungkook.—\n“Are you okay?” Jungkook was wiping his hair since it was wet. He immediately smiled when Tae came. \n“Yeah, I’m used to those.” He said and Tae nodded. “You’re so hot.” \nTae’s eyes widend. Did he just say his thoughts out loud? Well fuck.\nJungkook laughed. “I know.”—\n“Go to your training now, they’re starting already.” Jungkook ordered but Tae just pouted. \n“My body is sore. Can I just do it tomorrow?” He cried. “You can’t, love. You’re a future soldier.” \nTae paused, but his heart was beating so hard. “Did you just call me love?”—\nJungkook shrugged. “Is it bad? I thought we’re together?” He asked. \nTae heaved a breathe and he can’t control his smile. Does Jungkook not know that he’s so flustered? God, he just wanted to kiss him again. \n“No, love.” They both laughed when Tae said that.\n—\n“Uhm, excuse me?” \nThey both turned their heads behind them when they heard a feminine voice. \nIt was a very unfamiliar face for Tae, but for Jungkook, it isn’t. \nThe crowd were staring, the woman was beautiful and they’re wondering who she is.—\n“I-I’m sorry to meddle in, but can I excuse Jungkook for awhile?” She asked politely, she really looks angelic. \n“Lisa, this is Taehyung...T-Taehyung, this is Lisa...” \nHe didn’t want to say it, but the crowd was listening and its making it hard for him. \n“My fiancée.”—\nTae kept the smile on his face, but his heart fell on the ground with a shuttering noise. \nIt hurts so fucking much. \n“Nice to meet you, Lisa.” They shook hands, and Tae questioned himself. \nIs he just a toy for him? \n“If you won’t mind, can I talk to him for awhile?”—\nTae nodded with a smile. “Sure! He’s your fiancée after all.” He said and turned his back to leave. \nJungkook was about to call him but it’ll be suspicious. He felt so stupid, but he had no choice for now. \n“I need to talk to you about something. Let’s go.”\n"},{"title":"41","data":"221. \nThe sun was setting already, meaning that their trainings are over for today. \nBut right before Namjoon’s eyes, was Taehyung who’s having a sparring with a dummy. \n“Taehyung-ah, you should rest now.” He said, but Tae just continued punching the dummy. \nHe looks angry.—\n“A-Are you alright?” Namjoon asked, Tae looks so serious. \n“I’m fine, thank you.” But he knew he doesn’t. His eyes were reflecting the light and its glistening. Its also a bit red and swollen.\nWas he crying? \n“Okay, just call me when you need something.” He said and left.—\nRight after the door shut, he didn’t care anymore and let his body fell on the ground. His legs has been shaking since awhile ago but he didn’t want to feel it. \nBut now, he’s just had enough. \nTears started rolling down his cheeks again. And his heart hurts so much.\n\n                                <img

He slowly stood up and wiped his tears. \nHis heart feels so heavy, even his head. He’s thinking too much and he knew he can’t sleep tonight. \nHe didn’t even noticed that his fists were bleeding a bit.— \nHe decided to go out of the training room. \nIt was all fine and normal until he noticed the unnecessary amount of soldiers outside their rooms. \nThey were whispering to each other and its making Tae anxious.\nHe saw his teammates talking about something so he came to them.—\n“What’s going on?” He asked, and he immediately got their attention. \nTheir next words is what Tae wasn’t expecting. “Captain was jailed just awhile ago for killing Lieutenant Han.”\nTae’s world literally stopping moving. He was so silent and trying to figure out everything.—\n“Excuse me, what?” Tae couldn’t believe it. “General came here awhile ago and called Captain into his office. Then Captain came out with bruises on his face, looks like General did a beating.” \nTae didn’t know what to feel. He’s already in jail? Without being inspected?—\nThey were surprised when Tae suddenly ran away. \nHis feet took him to a familiar way, and his heart feels so furious. He needs answers, he always does. \nHe came home even though its prohibited for them to go out the camp on the days of trainings. \nHe doesn’t care anymore.—\nHis family was so surprised when they saw Tae standing right in front of the door, face looking so serious. \n“Son, you’re not allowed to—“ He couldn’t hold back his anger anymore and shouted. \n“Is it fun abusing your power?” He scoffed, and his father looks surprised.—\n“What?” With the noise, Jennie slowly came downstairs to see what was happening. \n“You put him in jail without any inspection?” He cried, his mom appeared and she looks confused. “Honey, what’s happening?” \nHis father chuckled.—\n“The blood with cloth that has his name on it was enough as an evidence.” \nTae realized something. He was talking about the uniform with blood. And Tae knew it was caused by the baby. \n“How the fuck are you sure it’s Lieutenant’s blood.” \n“Taehyung, watch your language.”—\nHis mother said but Tae did not pay attention to it. He knew his father did not deserve the respect he’s giving. \n“Just go back the camp and don’t meddle in the case.” \n“You expect me to stay quiet? I’m so fucking tired of that! And you know what? You deserve the jail more—“—\nA hard slap met Taehyung’s face and it made everyone shocked. He fell on the ground and his cheeks were stinging. \nTears started flowing down his cheeks. \n“Jaewon, stop!” His mother meddled in and held Taehyung. \n“You can hit and hurt me all you want but not my children!”—\nHis father scoffed. “You wanna go to jail so bad huh? Then let’s get you to jail with him.” \nHe grabbed Tae’s neck like he’s suffocating him. “I am your father, and you will obey me if you want the best for you.” \nBut he wasn’t threatened. He knew he’s on the right side.—\nHe threw him off the floor and he left. \nTae was shaking and coughing because of the lack of oxygen awhile ago. His mother was almost in tears. \n“I’m sorry mom, I’m really—“ His mother immediately pulled him for a hug. \n“Shh, you have nothing to be sorry for.”—\nYoongi and Jennie came to them. And Jennie felt so shocked. “Why didn’t you tell us that dad was hitting you?” \nTheir mom did not speak, she didn’t want them to know but now they do. He’s been beating her up ever since, but she can’t complain or their lives will be in danger.—\nLet’s move out! We can’t live with him!” Jennie insisted, he can’t believe he idolized his father for being such a good husband, parent &amp; general. \n“No, you need to finish your studies in the US. You need to graduate first.” His mother said. \nAnd Yoongi had nothing to do.—\nHe’s the eldest among all of them. He should be the one protecting them especially their mom, but even him couldn’t protect himself from the abuse. \nBut now he promised, he’ll be braver. \nThey hugged each other in tears. And once again, Tae felt what a family is.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/0681ad794d363a699405ca6f91bf0fdf1190b813/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f3631446575473348346b5f6a78513d3d2d36332e313639336663656536656632353165623933313739383534353634372e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\" And once again, Tae felt what a family is\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/af8a9c0cb0f13a49ec41bbea0027550a0929cabd/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f565f4f79632d336a504d387247413d3d2d36332e3136393366636565666137323464356137363137353130353837322e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"494\" alt=\"226\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n<br>226. \nWith two civil guards holding his arms, Taehyung was dragged inside the prison with only torches serving as the light. \nFar from the modernized prison, this one looks more of like a cave with steel bars on it. \nIts just a bit suffocating.—\nHe was thrown inside a cell, and there another person inside it — he knew who, but his heart was to heavy to even just look at his face. \nWell, you think its just going to be like that? Going to prison for a day for disobeying camp rules? \nNo, his father had other plans.—\nThe other guard poured salt on the ground, not that much but enough to make two buckets of water salty. \nThe other guard rolled up Tae’s pants up his knees. “Kneel down there.” He ordered. \nTae felt scared, he knew what they were trying to do.—\nThis is one of the punishments back then — you will kneel on salt then carry books above your head and hands, if the book falls — the timer goes back to 0. \n“I said kneel down!” Tae flinched on the voice, and Jungkook did too. He was sleeping and now he’s awake.—\nSurprised to see his lover in front him, Jungkook had no words. \nTae had no other choice but to kneel on the salt. “Agh...” he cried, it was just the start but he can feel the grains of salt piercing into his knees. \nIt hurts so much, but his heart hurts more.—\nThey let him extend his both arms on his side, like on a ‘T’ positions. They put two book on each hand and three books above his head. \n“Two hours, if you drop a book then you’ll repeat again.” The guard said then locked the bars and left.—\nIt just started, but he can already feel his body shaking. His knees are already bleeding &amp; the salt is making it harder. \n“Taehyung...” Jungkook muttered in a weak voice. His heart is hurting by seeing Tae in that state. \nHe promised himself to protect him, but what now?—\n“Taehyung I-“ \n“No. Keep your words to yourself.” \nFor the second time, Jungkook felt his heart shutter. He wanted to hug him, hold him and kiss him — but he doesn’t think Taehyung would like that. \nHe was chained on the other side of the cell. And Tae was on the opposite.—\nHow are you?\nAre you mad? \nI miss you. \nI want to hug you.\nI’m sorry. \nJungkook heaved a sigh and a shaky breathe. \nI love you. \nHe wanted to say those so much to him, but right now isn’t the right time. He’s still mad, and he has all the right to be.—\nHe looked at Tae, and he’s looking down on the ground. He was biting his lip like he’s trying to control his sobs. \nBut the tears were quite obvious since its falling onto the ground. \n“I’m sorry.” Jungkook felt so bad. “About Lisa—“ \n“I said I don’t want to hear from you.”—\nJungkook immediately shut down. He fiddled with his fingers since he knew its the only thing he can do for now. \nThey were right in front of each other. But they felt so distanced. So close, yet so far. \nEven if Tae wasn’t complaining, he knew he’s in much pain.—\nHe saw another full bottle of salt on the side — in between of them. There are also books. \nHe quickly grabbed the bottle and poured it onto the ground in his place. He started to roll up his pants up to his knees and caught Tae’s attention. \n“What the fuck are you doing?”—\nHe asked with swollen eyes and red nose. Jungkook grabbed the books and put three on his head and both hands. \nHe knelt down on the salt and groaned a bit at the pain, then copied Tae’s position. \n“Stop that!” Tae cried when he realize what he was doing.—\nBut Jungkook just closed his eyes, and continued on what he was doing. \n“Are you insane?! You don’t have a punishment, stop it!” But Tae felt unheard. \n“You know what? Fuck you! I hate you so much! Who do you think you are to play with my feelings? I hate hate hate you!”—\nJungkook just listened to him and accepted all the words he says even though its paining his heart. \n“I thought you were better than other people, I thought you knew how to respect but I just failed myself.” \nTae was bawling in tears, his voice is full of anger and hurt.\n"},{"title":"43","data":"—\nBut after that, no words came out from Tae’s mouth anymore — just sobs that symbolizes pain. \nAnd Jungkook knew how much he’s hurt him. \nJungkook bit the insides of his mouth to control his tears. He has no right to cry.—\nJust a few moments later, Taehyung calmed down, but his groans were indicating his pain on the knees. \nThey were bleeding and the salt are tinted with blood. Same as to Jungkook. \nHe wanted to help Tae, but he couldn’t reach him. So he just decided to do as what he was.—\n“I know you have no fault. I know they’re just setting you up. And I know that you know that. But why are you not speaking?” \nTae asked, and Jungkook doesn’t know what to say. Tae scoffed. “You’re a fucking coward. Did they also pay you for this?”—\nTae was finally out the cell when he heard a slapping sound and Jungkook groans. \nThe guard was hitting him with a whip and for the first time, Tae saw his face. \nIts full of bruises. \nThe whip hit his face and it left a scar on his left cheek. “Stop that!”—\nTae cried, and civil guard immediately glared at him. “You wanna be hit too huh?” He asked and Tae just went silent. \nEven though he’s hurt, Jungkook felt a bit happy knowing that Tae still cares. \n“Get him out of here now!” The guard ordered and the others held his arms.—\nTae took one last glance of Jungkook and his lips had blood. His heart ached at the sight. \nHe hated him for hurting him again. But he hated him even more because after all that, he still loves him. \nThe guards dragged him out of the prison.\n\n                                <img

\n"},{"title":"44","data":"231. \nTae was all quiet, thinking to himself. All he was hearing was the whispering of some people inside the room — they’re not that many tho — but enough for Tae to feel uncomfy. \nThe judge isn’t still there, and so is Jungkook.—\nHow he wish he could leave right now, how he wish he could just disappear without them noticing. \nHe doesn’t want to hear nor see anything, but he knew he had no choice. He always does. And it sucks so much. \nThe door opened and all the chattering went off.—\nJungkook came in with two police holding his arms. He was wearing a prisoner’s cloth, and his face had more bruise. \nHe’s being beaten up in the prison, how dare they? \nBut other than the two police, he had no one sitting on his side. \nJust him. All alone.—\nAnd Tae’s heart ached. He felt a lot of pity, knowing that Jungkook is facing this all alone — no one by his side. \nHe immediately looked down when they met gazes. He’s tearing up again, and its all because of him. \nHe clenched his fists on his lap.—\nHe wanted to go to him and tell him that he have him. But he knows that it’s quite impossible for now. \nHe knows he’s innocent, he knows it was just a set up. \nBut what is he, against a person who is more powerful than him. \nFuck justice. Fuck it.—\nTae calmed himself, its not the right time to cry now. \nA lot people were sitting on his father’s side, while no one even dared to linger a finger on Jungkook’s side. \nNot long after, the judge arrived. And his father felt nothing but confidence. \nTaehyung hated it.—\nBut Jaewon’s smile immediately faded away when he saw the unfamiliar judge. \nHis eyes we’re bawled, and even his attorney was surprised. \n‘What’s to be surprised about?’ Tae wondered, but he knew he can never get an answer for now.THE FOLLOWING INFORMATIONS ARE JUST FICTIONAL❗️IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY DEPARTMENT OR GOVERNMENT ❗️—\nThe judge sat on its place. “Call the case.” She ordered. \nThe clerk flipped a paper and read, “Kim Jaewon Vs Jeon Jungkook. Criminal case No. 1814 for Homicide. This is for arraignment.” \nThe judge nodded. “Appearances for prosecution.”— \nThe clerk read again. “Atty. Min Hyungseok, Assistant Prosecutor Han Joyeon, Atty. Park Haeun, 2nd assistant prosecutor, and Atty. Jang Ae Ri, Private Prosecutor.” \nTae understood that Jungkook is all alone. But shouldn’t he have his attorney with him?—\n“Appearance for defense.” \n“Atty. Cha Jiyeon, and Attorney Lee Hanbin. But Mr. Lee isn’t present.” \nThe judge’s eyebrow shot up, eyeing on Jungkook who’s looking so lonely. \n“Mr. Jeon, where is your attorney?” Jungkook looked up, “He’s dead.” \nAnd Jaewon smirked.—\nTae felt enraged. By seeing his father’s reaction, he knew he planned all this. He’s very sure he killed Jungkook’s attorney on purpose so that he could immediately win. \n“So what are we gonna do now? You don’t have an attorney?” The judge asked.—\nJungkook can be charged for this with a new case about not obeying the court rules. \nAnd that’s going to be a lot more danger. \nIf he doesn’t have an attorney with him, then his father automatically wins. And Jungkook will be filed in for another case.—\nJungkook was about to stand up but Tae was faster. He immediately caught everyone’s attention. \n“I’m sorry to meddle in, your honor. But I would like to present myself as his attorney.” \nEveryone was shocked. I mean, who wouldn’t? Coming from someone who’s from another side?—\nHis father was glaring at him, but Tae didn’t get threatened.\nJaewon’s attorney stood up. “Your honor, he’s not capable of defending the suspect. He has no exp—“ \n“I graduated law and topped the boards with 94.8. I may not have the experience but I know what I’m doing.”—\nThe other attorney was shut up when the judge spoke. \n“I accept it. Now, shall we continue the hearing?” \nTae felt determined. He went to Jungkook’s side and saw his reaction. He was surprised. \nAnd even Tae was surprised by himself.\n\n                                <img

judge ordered and once again, the clerk started reading. “Accused JEON JUNGKOOK commits a crime of homicide, Art 297, committed as follows,”— \n“That on or about 9 o’ clock in the evening on December 6th, 1894 in the Capital of Baekje, South Korea, within the jurisdiction of this court, the accused did then &amp; there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously attack, assault and wounded one, HAN JIPYEONG.”—\n“By then and there fists him all over his body, then stabs him with a sword two times which causes the victim to cease. That the accused is a person in authority being an Army Captain, contrary to law.”\nTae has his ears all open, making sure he hears every detail.—\nThe judge asked Jungkook, “Do you understand the allegations of the facts?” \nJungkook nodded, “Yes, your honor.” \n“What is your plea?” \n“Not guilty, your honor.” Some people who were in the room were whispering to each other. Probably making another fuss.—\n“His uniform was found inside a cell and its covered with blood. The cloth was found not far from the crime scene. The cloth was found at approximately 10 minutes after the murder.” \nHe sat back down with confidence in his face. While Tae was dying to slap him in the face.—\n“Do you agree with the information?” The judge was talking to Taehyung and he immediately stood up. \n“I object, your honor.” He said. \n“I do agree with the part where they found the accused’s cloth covered in blood. But that blood doesn’t belong to the victim.”—\n“The accused helped a woman in labor &amp; became a substitute for the midwife since it will take time for them to come. The blood came from the baby, not the victim. And I can prove it because I was with him.” \nThere’s nothing to be scared of, they knew theyre in the right side.—\n“Your honor, the defense has no witness. Even if he’s with the accused that time, we still can’t confirm if they’re telling the truth.” \nTae looked around and saw someone familiar, then looked back at the judge. \n“Our witness is just around, your honor.”—\nEveryone started looking inside the room, trying to find out who was Taehyung talking about. \n“Please point at the witness.” The judge ordered. \n“I’m sorry your honor, but I don’t want to force the witness to speak. I’ll let their conscience decide for it.”—\nThe judge felt amazed, but its not necessary at this time. They waited for some seconds, and people are just whispering. \n“Witness, is it okay for you, that the person who saved you &amp; your child would be jailed for the crime he did not do?” \nTaehyung asked.—\nNot long after, a woman from the other side of the chair stood up. She was the witness. \nTae smiled, he knew it was going to work. Nothing can be stronger than guilt and conscience. \n“Are you the witness?” The judge asked her, and she slowly nodded. “Yes, your honor.”—\n“Is the defense stating the truth?” The judge asked once again, and she nodded. \n“Yes, your honor.” \nTae saw his father’s expression, and its eyeing on him with fire in his eyes. \nHe just looked back at him, because he doesn’t deserve any single word from him.—\n“I object, your honor.” Tae mentally rolled his eyes. When will this fucker run out of excuses? \n“I can assure you that they’re lying. They have no enough and strong proof about what they’re saying. And as to what I know, Captain was ordered to do something important—“—\n“Either you, have no enough proof.” Tae cut him off. “Its a holiday so even the authorities are allowed to celebrate. Plus, there was no investigation held and you quickly sent the accused to jail and for hearing.” \nThe judge’s eyebrows shot up &amp; immediately called the clerk.—\nJaewon met gazes with his attorney and his eyes were burning in anger. \nWell, I guess his attorney said something against them. Oops? \nThe judge looked back at them. “Defense, may I ask why there is no investigation held before the accusations?”—\n“Your honor, I believe that the evidences caught were already enough.” \n“Your honor, investigation is a must. How can they be so sure of the accused if they only have object as evidences?” Tae talked back. \n“I can’t believe I am fighting with an attorney who doesn’t——\neven have any experience. And investigation is not always a must. Sometimes, its all just logic.” \n“Investigation is logic.” \n“You have no—“ \n“Enough! I’ve heard enough!” The judge beat the gavel on the circle wood. “You two may now sit.”—\nThey both sat down. The judge were having a talk with the other prosecutors and attorneys by his side. Probably talking about who won the case. \nAnd even though Tae knew he was right, he still felt nervous. \nWhat if he did not do well? What if he did not defend him well?—\nJungkook saw his hand shaking. They were sitting beside each other, and he knew that Tae was nervous. \nIt was his first time to actually attend a hearing, it must’ve been hard for him. \nHe gently put his hand above Tae’s cold ones. And it immediately caught his attention.<br>—\nThey both sat down. The judge were having a talk with the other prosecutors and attorneys by his side.

They were sitting beside each other, and he knew that Tae was nervous. \nIt was his first time to actually attend a hearing, it must’ve been hard for him. \nHe gently put his hand above Tae’s cold ones. And it immediately caught his attention.—\nJungkook did nothing, he just held his hand, and looked right into his eyes. Because even if its impossible, they understood each other. \nTae gave him an impish smile and held his cuffed hands back. It felt warm, and it relaxed Taehyung. \nHe missed him.—\n“We have decided.” The judge sat back to his seat. And even just by his words, its making everyone nervous. \nThe clerked opened a paper and read it. “Based on the defenses, the said accused, JEON JUNGKOOK, is proven...” \n“Guilty.”—\nTae’s eyes shot open due to shock. He felt so angry and he can feel his blood rise up to his head. \n“Excuse me?! How—“ \nThey saw the clerk panicking. “I’m sorry, no! I read it wrong. My apologies.” Tae’s heart stoppe for awhile. \n“The accused is proven not guilty.”—\nOut of happiness, Tae did not notice that he was hugging Jungkook, and Captain’s heart stopped for awhile. \nHe’s so happy, he felt like crying. \nAfter some moments of congratulating, they were out of the room already. And Jungkook was getting ready for his release.—\nA lot of people were outside, and Jungkook was looking for Tae. And luckily, he found him. \n“Mr. Kim!” He called, and it quickly caught his attention. Now, theyre standing infront of each other, no one was speaking. What should they say?\n“Congrats.” They both said in unison.—\nIt felt awkward. “Thanks.” Jungkook started. “For standing up for me.” He said. \nTae nodded, “I did that as your friend.” \nJungkook’s heart broke. As a friend? The person he loves treats him as a friend only? It hurts. \n“C-Can we talk?” Jungkook asked.—\n“Were already talking.” \n“You know what I mean.” \nOf course he does, but he’s trying to avoid the topic. “I have trainings. My father only just excused me for this.” \n“How about after your training?” Tae didn’t want to look at him, cuz those eyes would make him say ‘yes.’\n"},{"title":"46","data":"235. \nJungkook sat bolt upright as soon as he felt himself drifting asleep. He saw the moon and its approximately 10 in the evening. \nHe’s been waiting for 9 hours now. But he made his waiting time productive since he did some important works. \nBut up to now, Tae hasn’t come.—\nHe thought that maybe he’s just busy. Maybe he’s doing something right now, and he’ll come later. \nBut he’s been thinking that for the past few hours and even Tae’s shadow wasn’t seen. \nHe felt a bit unmotivated, but he still wanted to wait for him.\n“He’ll come, he will.”—\nWhile on the other hand, Tae was standing right in front the camp gate. It was his turn to guard it until 12 in midnight. \nHe was still, but his thoughts were so occupied. \nHe knew Jungkook was waiting. But he wasn’t ready for what he’s gonna say. \nTruth hurts, eh?—\nRight before his eyes, woman on horse with another guy on another horse. \nIt was quite odd for him too see that especially that there is a curfew for people when night. \nThe face became clear, and he can hear his heart break again when he saw Lisa — Jungkook’s fiancée.—\nLisa went down the horse and they bowed to each other. Luckily, Tae was with his other team mate on duty so he’s not alone. \n“Goodevening Miss Manoban, Captain Jeon is inside his office.” \nTae immediately said without having an eye contact with her. \nHe heard Lisa chuckled.—\n“I’m not here for him. But rather for you.” Tae immediately looked up to surprise, what did she just say? \n“Me?” He asked again, cuz what if he’s just hearing things?\nLisa nodded, “Yes. I need to talk to you.” She said and Tae felt nervous. \n“Can I borrow him for awhile?”—\nShe asked the other soldier, and he nodded. “Don’t worry, it wont be long. My guard can substitute him for awhile.” \nThey went beside the camp where there is a small park. Its night, but the sky is brighter than black. \n“What can I do for you Mrs. Jeon?”—\nLisa giggled. “Mrs. Jeon?” She asked and Tae nodded. “You’re his fiancée, you’re soon to be a Jeon.” \nHe flashed a smile, even though he’s dying emotionally. His heart is aching knowing that he’s talking to the person who is going to marry the person he loves.—\n“Actually,” Lisa sat on the bench near the tree. “I’m here to talk to you about that.” \nTae gulped, he doesn’t know why he’s nervous. He’s always avoiding this topic, but now — it has come to an end. \n“W-What about it?” He asked, sitting not far beside her.—\nLisa sighed, “Jungkook trusts you, so I know that I can trust you too.” Tae slowly nodded. \n“But promise me that you won’t tell anyone about everything that I’ll tell you.” \nWhat is this? Why is it scaring him to death? “I promise.”—\nWithin just words, its enough to make Taehyung freeze. Literally freeze — he has stopped breathing for a while. \n“We’re not truly fiancées.” Eyes shot open in the state of shock, unable to blink. Lisa was expecting that reaction.—\n“What...?” Tae has so many questions, but only that word came out from his mouth. \n“I know what you two have in between. And I’m telling you this because I don’t want to ruin anything.” \nWithout noticing, tears fell from Tae’s eyes — joy and sadness — either of the two.—\n“T-then why did you two pretend to be that?” He asked, he feels so confused. What’s the need of pretending about that? \nLisa sighed. “I can’t tell you everything yet. But thank you for saving him in the court. I hired an attorney for him but your father killed her.”—\n“Your father hired a judge to set him up in death sentence so since I have some connections in the court, I changed the judge that attended the hearing. Jungkook was supposed to be the attorney to himself but you made it easier for him. Thank you so much.”—\n“I have many more to tell you but I think that’s his job now.” \nTae has no words left in him, but the tears won’t stop falling. He can’t believe what he’s hearing. \n“He’s waiting for you, please go talk to him. He’s been talking &amp; thinking about you ever since that day.”—\n“I-I can’t, I’m scared—“ \nLisa held his hand to comfort &amp; make him feel better. \n“You don’t have too. He trusts you and I hope you do too. Jungkook loves you so much and only the gods know how much. I know you do too. I did my part, now its your turn to fix each other.”—\nIt took Tae awhile to sink in everything that Lisa told him. But he&nbsp; thought she’s right. \n“I guess you’re right. Nothing will happen if I’ll just avoid him.” \nThey stood up and Tae dried his tears. “Thank you so much for telling me. I assure you that you can trust me.”—\nLisa smiled, she felt happy that she knew he helped. She’s quite feeling guilty because she knew that Tae was avoiding Jungkook because of her, and she can’t take the guilt anymore. \n“B-But, are you not disgusted of a man inlove with a man?” \nTae asked, he felt quite scared.\n—\nLisa shook her head. “Why would I be? I mean it’s quite weird and new for me but I think we should normalize that.” \nTae felt touched about her words, he felt guilty for being mad at her. She’s a nice girl. \nThey went back to the gate and right before Lisa leaves, she spoke.—\n“Mr. Kim, please always be careful.

I probably deserve this.” He said and he can feel tears from his eyes.—\nBut all his pain was washed off when a knock on the door broke the silence. \nHe had no second thoughts and immediately opened it. \nHis heart was beating so fast, and he can feel it beating through his head. \n“H-hey.” Thats all the words he said. “I thought you weren’t co—“—\nA pair of lips met his, he pause in his state of shock. He did not expect him to do that. \nBut soon after, he felt himself kissing back. The sound of the door closing was heard and they felt more safe. \nLips were moving in chorus, and even tears started falling down.—\nThey missed that kind of sensation, even if it just happened once, they still did. It felt like a thousand of years since they saw each other. \nTheir hands were exploring each others. All touching and kissing, no one would judge them in their own little world.—\nTae did not even noticed that Jungkook has carried him onto his desk, and he’s not sitting on the edge. \nIt felt like hours of kissing, &amp; they’ll never be tired of it. Tae clung his arms around Koo’s nape to deepen the kiss, and he can feel his hands snake around his waist.—\nIt’s overwhelming for Tae, they broke the kiss and that’s when he started to break into tears. \nSobs were against Jungkook’s shoulders, and he can’t feel his tears dropping down his clothes. \nOut of happiness, he shed a tear — he’s never cried, but now is a different story.—\n“I’m sorry for being mad at you, I’m sorry for not believing you, I’m sorry for avoiding you, I’m so dumb, I’m sorry, I really am—“ \n“Shh...you’re not on fault.” \nThey went silent for awhile, hugging each other and knowing that they have together...finally.—\nThey missed this, they missed being beside each other, being all comfortable and happy. \nAnd finally, afterall the happenings, they’re back to each other’s arms. \nThey finally calmed down from crying, and now, it’s time for a serious talk.—\nTae fidgeted on his finger, “D-Did you wait for too long?” He asked. \n“11 hours isn’t long.” Tae laughed at him but he felt bad too. Thats so long. \n“I’m sorry, for not hearing you out first. Lisa talked to me and explained everything.”—\n“Then I guess I had nothing to say anymore?” Jungkook chuckled and Tae smiled. \n“You have so many, but I don’t want to talk about serious things for now.” \nHe quickly placed a kiss on Jungkook’s lip and it made him startled, but he smiled after. \n“I missed you.”—\n“You’re being brave now? Kissing me suddenly?“ \nTae smacked him on the arm which made him laugh. He’s teasing him again. “I take it back. I didn’t miss you.” \nTae was the one surprised now when Jungkook placed a quick kiss on his lips. \n“I missed you too, hyung.”—\nTae blushed at the sudden honorific. \nWithout holding back, they devoured each others lips again. Touching and kissing here and there.\nAnd who knows what happened that night?\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/7b143317a8af52d5a2b18e81a044041fc3b77409/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f3176376867325859356e366a48513d3d2d36382e313639343233386563306339366662653433353139343033313232302e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"And who knows what happened that night?\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/5b546def8860b5e97c6ad9ac6bad60a7ff7f9ba6/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f48427357764c516347454b7870413d3d2d36382e313639343233386636623332356132313930303833393639323831302e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/2838c6b5b3a7f1717492cb45db05c5c7ecdfb4c8/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f2d76385347724e706f50584f67413d3d2d36382e313639343233393037653539393136633531353030343834383438352e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n"},{"title":"48","data":"[ FLASHBACK ]239. \n“Jung—hey, we—‘ve been kissing for—hours now...mhm...” \nTae said in between their kisses. Its true tho, they’ve been cuddling and kissing for how long? Neither them knew. \nMaybe, they just really longed for each other. \n“Then should we have a talk?” Jungkook asked.—\nJungkook sat on his chair desk, while Tae is still sitting on the side of the desk. \nThe room was dark, since they chose not to turn on the light. The only thing that serves as one was the shine of the moon. \n“What should we talk abt?” \n“Why did u not speak about the case?”[ ❗️WARNING❗️]\nThe next few chapters do not intend anything against the said country. Its all fictional.—\nJungkook saw that coming, he knew he was gonna ask. “I can’t tell you everything yet,” \n“They killed Mr. Han because he found out all the illegal firearms, drugs, and even transactions with the US.” \nTae frowned at the country. “US?”—\n“He tried to expose them but he ended up to death. Sorry to say but your father was the one who ordered it.” \nTae felt his blood rush up to his head. He felt so angry, so so angry to the point that he can’t clench his fists more.—\n“They set me up to mislead the case on the real suspect. And your father didn’t want me to guard you anymore, so he just decided to set me off like that.” \nTae breathe in. He needs to calm himself. “We should tell the police! Or the court! I don’t care if he’s my father—“—\n“No, we can’t...yet.” Jungkook held his hand to calm him down, and luckily, he did. \n“Why not?” \n“He’s a General. He has many connections more than you thought. \nAs usual, its always like that. Nothing new, people always choose money rather than truth. \nHow awful.—\n“But If not now, then when? You say he has many connections, then how are we going to get him behind the bars?” \n“If he has strong connections in the politics, then otherwise is with the people.” \nTae went silent for a second, trying to process what Jungkook has just said.—\n“You mean to say, we will let the people realize what’s happening?” Jungkook nodded. \nPeople might seem gullible, but they’re all smart. They will knew if they’re being abused. And they’ll not hesitate to fight against it. \nCitizens are more powerful than the government.—\nIf only the citizens would be brave enough to speak, then anything can be conquered. \nTae nodded, he got it already. But there are questions in his head. \n“Why did you faked your engagement with Lisa?” He asked. He knew it was fake, but his heart is still sullen.—\n“And you did not answer my previous question. Why did you not speak against the case?” He asked once again. \n“I explained it all. If I spoke against it, they’ll be caught in the wrong time. And everything will get worse.” \nTae nodded, “And my other question?”—\nJungkook let out a shaky breathe, he doesn’t know if he should say it today. But if not now, then when? \n“About that,” he stood up, and held his hand tight onto his heart like he’s scared of his reaction. \n“We’re getting married next month.”—\nTae did not move even a finger, he’s just steady. \n“Hyung, the marriage is fake. We’re just doing that for something important. Please, don’t be mad.” \nTae knew it was fake, even though he didn’t know the reason. But his heart still ached. \nHe flashed a smile.—\n“I know. I’m not mad. I understand.” He said and held back Jungkook’s hand. \nJungkook knew he’s not fine with it — even him. But this is the only way to save everything. \n“After our wedding, we’ll fly right to the US to proceed to our plan. But that won’t be long.”—\n“Why can’t you just buy a ticket and fly all the way to US?” \nJungkook shook his head. “I’m a Captain, an authority. All my flights and transactions are recorded in papers. If I suddenly fly away like that, they’ll question me.”—\nTae felt a bit sad, and worried. He doesn’t know whats gonna happen next. And he doesn’t want to know. \nWhat if he already changed the history, and his death would not be the same anymore? \nWhat if it’ll be earlier, or late? Or just the same again? \nOr can he just not die?<br>—\nJungkook noticed his worrying face and kissed the back of his hand. It caught Tae’s attention and gave him an assuring look. \n“Nothing bad will happen. I’ll come back for you, I promise.” \nAtleast, he had an assurance. “Promise?” \nJungkook smiled. “Promise.”\n\n      <img

You have your silencers with you, don’t make any unwanted noises so that we won’t bother the animals. Understood?” \n“Sir, yes sir!” \nThere are not much of soldiers in front of the forest for nature purposes.—\nThe assistant handed the trainer a box. “This contains all your missions to do. But before you pick, we will set you into partners.” \nJungkook was standing on the side, supervising everything. Its his job.\nThe trainer announced all the partners, “Kim Taehyung &amp; Park Bogum.”—\nTae felt a bit stunned, he knew Jungkook was jealous of Bogum. So he immediately looked at his expression, but it was all normal. \nThat’s quite odd. \nOr maybe, Tae was just overreacting. He shrugged it off and fell in line with Bogum, the others had their partners already.—\n“You only have to pick one inside. The mission written on the paper that you’ll get will be your mission. The time will be around 20 minutes.” \nThe soldiers fell in line and picked their unpredicted mission. Some were happy about it, some were not. \nBut Tae, he’s quite fine.—\nHe felt relieved, “Ours was easy.” He was the one who picked the mission. He showed Bogum the small paper. \n“Shoot a dear with just one bullet.” Bogum read, “It’s easy, but we’ll have to shoot it in the head if thats the mission.” \nTae nodded, even though he felt nervous.—\n“Bring your finish product and come back here. Your 20 minutes starts now.” \nEveryone immediately went to their places and started doing their mission. \nTae’s eyes we’re sharp and kept looking around the place just incase there’s a deer. \n“Hey, we’re just in the front,”—\n“Deers are often far inside the forest.” Bogum chuckled and Tae realized it too. \nHe laughed to himself, “Just checking.”\nIt was 10 minutes of looking for a deer, but Tae’s feet got tired first. <br>There’s only 10 minutes left, but that felt quite long for Tae.—\n“Are you okay?” Bogum asked when Tae stopped by a nearby tree. “Can we rest for a little? My legs are tired.” \nTae complained, Bogum hesitated at first, but he immediately agreed. “Okay, maybe a 30 seconds is enough?” \nTae gawked. “No way, that’s too short!”—\nBogum laughed, “I know, I was just teasing you.” Tae felt himself blush. He realized he was too gullible. \n“A minute, that should be enough—“ , “AAAAH!” Bogum flinched at Tae’s sudden scream. \n“WHATTHEFUCKISTHATMOTHERFUCKER?!” He cried, his voice was too loud.—\nBogum felt confused, Tae was holding onto his sleeves tightly and was hiding behind him in fear. \n“What is it?” Tae’s grip tightened. “Something touched my ankle—“ \nhissssssssssssssssssssssss. \nBoth of their eyes bawled at the sound.—\n“A SNAKE?!” They both cried in unison. \nBut before they even realize it, the snake was right in front of them, flaunting its scales and fiery eyes on them. \nIt was a black mamba and its very fast. \nPlus, there are three of them.—\nBogum’s first instinct is to just walk away calmy, because snakes won’t attack you unless you provoke them. \n“Tae, we should follow the snake.” Bogum whispered, and Tae immediately cried. \n“ARE YOU CRAZY?! DO YOU WANT US TO—AAAAAAH!”—\nTae immediately ran when he saw the snake made a move towards them. \nBogum cursed under his breathe. Tae was being too loud. “Tae, stop running!” He ran after him.\nWhile Tae, was just continuously running. He hates snakes so much, oh no one knew how much.— \nHe didn’t want to die just because of a venom of that snake. Not in this era, for sure! \n“Taehyung, stop right there!” He heard Bogum’s voice and it sounds so alarming. \nBut his feet were just too fast to stop. His fear was turning into tears and he hated it.— \n“Taehyung, no!” Tae jumped across a river towards the other side, but he was about to run again when Bogum shouted. \n“THAT’S A LANDMINE AREA!” He immediately stopped moving, even he did not even dare to put down his other foot on the land. \n“W-What?”—\nBogum finally reached him. He was panting for breath because of the running. Tae was on the other side of the land. \n“There are lots of landmines there. Our lecturer told us, you did weren’t listening on the lectures, we’re you?” \nHe asked and Tae felt guilty.—\nTae slowly put down his other foot on the stone and turned around. “Is it true or you just joking around?” \nBogum shook his head, “Why would I joke about that?” He asked and Tae slowly shrugged. \n“I don’t know? What if you’re making up things?” He asked.—\n“Then try going in there, for sure you won’t survive if ever.” Bogum challenged, because he knew Tae wouldn’t. \nTae looked back, the area really looked dangerous.\n“You should believe me, I’m a bomb disposal technician. I know landmines too well. I can never be a victim—“—\nBogum paused on his mid-sentence, even his breathing stopped. \nTae felt odd about it and furrowed his brows, “Are you okay?” He asked, and Bogum smiled. \n“Of course.” Tae inspected him. “You look stiff.”\n“No, I’m totally fine.” \n“Did you step on a landmine?”—\nBogum laughed, but he was really stiff and only his mouth was moving. \n“Haha, me? A bomb disposal technician?” He asked and laughed again. \nBut this time, he was begging. “Please help me.” \nTae laughed hard when he confirmed that Bogum really did stepped on a landmine.—\nHe was almost kneeling on the stones with his hands on his stomach. \nHis eyes we’re smiling and that boxy smile of his can never be old. \nHe looked wonderful. Like a ball of sunshine. \nAnd even if Bogum was on the death line, he smiled too.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/20fcd3faa446e2d039fd5405492380b29dbcac0c/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f3059766b383264314f67536f66773d3d2d37302e313639343234336539663364383830633231373533303635383635302e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"And even if Bogum was on the death line, he smiled too\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/5fb12b823f7b4301e182f55d6019cd78764a1959/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f796e3368323656696171385a39513d3d2d37302e313639343234336566323930353034313235313639373038383032322e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"494\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/d82af280df73da662306ae69f0dd3cb2c8c63bae/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f544e3357693676783070704736513d3d2d37302e313639343234336639633836363339313534373332383535313036322e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"794\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n"},{"title":"50","data":"245.\nIt was the same punishment — carrying books while kneeling down the sea of salt. \nTae felt like crying coz his wounds had just been cured, &amp; now he’s gon’ have it again. \n“For one hour, I’ll be back after.” The trainer said after he saw them doing the punishment already.—\nThe trainer left. \nEven though it was just the start, Tae was already tearing up. He can feel his wounds opening up again, and its even painful because it was an old wound. \nHe was surprised when Bogum suddenly stood up. “Stand up.” He ordered. \n“Huh?”—\n“Come on, stand up.” Tae did not know what he’s planning but he did as he was told. \nBogum took out his handkerchief and he parted the salt first before putting it under. \n“Kneel here.” Tae felt confused. He knelt down on the handkerchief and it felt comfortable.—\nBogum quickly gathered the salt around Tae’s knees so no one will know that he’s kneeling on a handkerchief instead of salt. \nBogum fixed his books and he knelt down on the salt after. \nTae was silent and was still in confusion. Isn’t this cheating on a punishment?—\n“This is wrong...” Tae said.\n“No, they’re wrong too. I heard you had this punishment already so I’m sure that ur wound would open up again. It might get infected. That’s dangerous.” \nTae felt his heart beating fast. He was touched, he didn’t knew he cared this much.—\nHe’s right, his old wound might get infected. But he felt guilty since he wasn’t feeling the same pain as Bogum. \n“You should kneel on a handkerchief too—“ He let off a small laugh, even though he’s in pain. \n“No, I’m fine. I’m strong.” Tae giggled, he sounds like a kid.—\nSilence ruled over them, and there are lots of thoughts going in Tae’s head. \n“Thank you.” He said, and even though he can’t turn his head on the side because of the books, he knew Bogum was smiling. \n“No, thank you.” Tae felt confused on what he said. “Sorry, what?”—\nBogum chuckled. “Nothing, I said welcome.” He said and everything went silent again. \nBut deep inside his heart, he knew what he wanted to say. \n‘Thank you for coming into my life.’ Oh much he wanted to tell him that, but he knew his limitations. \nHe knew he can’t have him.—\nBecause he also knew, that he person he loves, has his heart for another person. \nAnd what is he, against a person who Taehyung loves the most? \nHe’s not even starting yet, but he knew he already lost. \nAt least, he just wanted to keep him safe. And that’s all that matters.\n\n                                <img

\n"},{"title":"51","data":"249. \n“How much is this?” Asked Tae’s mom, she was referring on the crab. \nTae was still quite distracted about the place, it was clean and tidy. There are lots of things you can buy, and of course people too. \nBut not as much people in the future.—\nThey bought the crab, and went to look for more food in the market. \n“Would you like anything, honey?” His mom asked and Tae immediately thought of something. \nHe saw not much far, a stall with scallops as their product. Oh damn, he love scallops.\n“Can I buy some scallops?”—\nHis mom nodded and Tae happily went to the stall, leaving his mom waiting not from afar. \nHe took a look at scallops and inspected it to see if its fresh and fine. \nSurprising, all of the scallops are looking fresh, and it looks like it just came out from the sea.—\nUnlike in the future, err...better not say. \nBut even if all looks so fresh, you need to pick the best among them. \nHe quickly bought a kilo of it and grabbed the plastic as soon as it was ready. \nHe turned to his mom and as to his surprise, she was talking to someone.—\nEven though that person is back-facing him, Tae’s heart immediately jumped as soon as he realized who it was. \nSmiling, he went towards them and his mother immediately noticed. “Oh! I forgot to say, Taehyung is with me.” \nBoth met gazes &amp; they couldn’t control their smiles.—\nJungkook bowed his head a little as a sign of acknowledgement. “Good morning, Mr. Kim.” \nTae did the same, “Good morning too, Captain.” His mother felt a bit confused when they started giggling at each other, but she did not show it. \nBecause maybe, she knew.—\n“I should get going, Mrs. Kim. Have a nice day.” Jungkook once again said before leaving. \nAs soon as it, Tae immediately asked her. “Why is Captain here?” \nThey started walking to find some more food. “He said he had an inspection in the nearest camp.”—\n“I was fixing the things we bought and I was struggling a bit with the tomatoes so he came to help me.” \nTae was smiling all along while his mother was telling him what happened. \nAnd his mother noticed to she tried to catch things.— \n“Captain looks quite glowing these days, maybe he’s inlove.” \nTae’s smile became wider but he noticed it so he immediately sucked the insides of his mouth to control his smile. \nHis mother looked away then lowkey smiled and nodded.\nYou know, a mother’s instinct?—\nIt was all a blur, Tae and his mother were still looking for some food and just a few more and they’ll be over. \n“Have you seen some potatoes? I need some.” His mother asked, and Tae immediately looked around the place to search for some. \nAnd he spotted one, “There!”—\nThey went towards the stall and started picking some potatoes. \n“Good morning, ma’am, sir, you’re on the right stall because we sell the best and delicious potatoes in the town!”\nHe chuckled at the tagline, but the voice felt too familiar for him to ignore.—\nHe immediately looked up, only to see Bogum on a simple shirt, with a big smile on his face while saying the tagline. \n“Bogum?” He said and it caught his attention. He looked surprised. “Taehyung?” \nHe immediately bowed at them as soon as he saw Tae’s mother.—\nThey’re one of the most known families in the town, might as well show respect, eh? \n“Good morning, Mrs. Kim!” He greeted, “You look wonderful, ma’am. No wonder why your son is handsome.” \nTae’s mother laughed at the words. “You have humor, don’t you?” She said.—\nHe giggled, “But I’m telling the truth&nbsp; ma’am.” \nTae’s mother felt touched and she felt that he’s sincere. “Thank you. And quit the formalities, you can cal me auntie since you’re friends with my son.” She said. \nTae heard it and he blushed a bit.—\nThey bought the potatoes and Tae’s mom paid much than the price. “Here’s the change ma’am—“ \n“No, keep it. You’re working hard, keep it up.” She smiled and handed him back the change. \n“Oh, just a sec. I’ll just buy an apple there. Wait for me here okay?” She told Tae.—\nAs soon as she left, they chatted. “You work here?” He asked and Bogum chuckled. “Well, yeah. I wanted to help my parents too while I’m in the camp.” \nTae nodded and looked at their other products. “I didn’t expect to see you here.” \n“You thought I’m rich?” Tae laughed.—\n“Well, I did somehow.” \nBogum kept his smile and sighed. “Sorry to say, but I’m just an average guy. We’re just poor, but I’m still thankful that we get to eat three times a day.” \nTae felt a bit sad, “That’s not to be sorry of. You’re helping your parents while ——\ntraining in the camp. That must be hard. And I hope you won’t be ashamed of this. It’s a decent job. Keep it up.” \nTae cheered him up. Bogum smiles all the time, but he never knew that his life was like this. It must be hard, but at least, he’s grateful.— \nThey left the market as soon as they completed the foods to buy. \nThey rode the callesa on their way home. But since his mother was curious of things, he asked Taehyung. \n“Hows your heart, son?” Tae felt surprised coz of the sudden question. \n“Huh?” \n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/d25928499476737c945664114e973235fe057c4b/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f4c4769713041314b6741525032513d3d2d37322e313639343234393933303136366463313236303438373036323039382e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"600\" data-original-height=\"380\" width=\"600\" height=\"380\" alt=\"“Huh?” \">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n"},{"title":"52","data":"—\nShe let off a smile. “Are you inlove?” She said, and Tae let out a nervous laugh. \nJust by the laugh, she knew her son was inlove. \nShe immediately held his hand to make him feel comfortable about the topic. \n“You know you can tell me anything right?” She said.—\nTae just nodded, but he’s still silent. He knew his mom knew that he’s inlove. But he’s afraid to say that he’s inlove with a MAN. \nWhat if he disappoints her? \n“You know, whoever you’re inlove with, any person, any gender — I will always support you, okay?”—\nBy her words, Tae felt a bit relieved. He felt like crying because even if he didn’t say it directly, he felt like he finally came out to his mom. \nHe smiled. “I love you, mom.” \nHer mom smiled back &amp; she kissed his forehead like he’s still her baby. \n“I love you too, son.”\n\n                                <img

He did a great job on the field and everything — and now, its time to have time for himself,” \nThe trainer said, Tae saw Jungkook standing in the front, but he did not look at him. \nOr else, he knew he’ll burst into tears.—\n“He’s leaving to the US. But it won’t be long, he’ll be back in a week. For now, he’s here to give his temporary farewell speech.” \nJungkook stood forward, replacing the trainer. He took a look at his people, and then Taehyung. \nHe felt an ache in his heart.<br>—\n“Just two more weeks to go, and you’re gonna be the soldier you’re made to be. I have no more else to say, but whatever happens — choose to protect your country, as you’ll also protect your family.” \nEveryone clapped at his short speech, until then, everything went to normal.—\nTae went back to his bench since it was a water break. He kept practicing taekwondo since its their last training. \nBut actually, he just wanted to distract himself. \nHe feel so angry, so sad and everything. \nHe didn’t want to cry, he hated himself for being so weak.—\n“Tae, you should take a rest first.” Hoseok commented. He obeyed him because his legs were feeling quite exhausted. \nHe sat on the bench and Hoseok looked down to his bowing face. “Are you okay?—“ \nWith that three words, Tae bursted in tears.—\n“Oh my, I’m sorry—did I say something wrong?” Hoseok was quite startled since its the first time he saw a man crying. \nTae immediately wiped his tears. “No, youre not on fault. I just got something on my eye, haha.” He faked a laugh, but Hoseok knew he wasn’t okay.<br>—\n“Tae, you can talk to me okay?” He said and caressed his back. He’s not good at words, but listening...of course. \nTae shook his head while keeping a smile on his face. \n“Hey! I’m fine! I’ll just go to the washroom, I’ll be quick.” He quickly stood up and ram away.—\nAs soon as he knew people couldn’t see him anymore, he hid himself behind a wall and started crying hard. \n“Why am I like this? Why am I so weak? Fuck you self! Can you atleast stop being a cry baby for once?!” He exclaimed, but quiet enough for people not to hear him.—\nJust as he thought he’s gonna be okay, a pair of hands snatched him into a dark alley. \nTae was shouting in panic, but it’s useless since his mouth was covered with a hand. \n“MRFHRDHAJD!” He cried. \nIs he being kidnapped again? Oh god, not again please.—\n“Hyung...” he immediately stopped when the person whispered. “Its me, Jungkook.” \nHe can feel his breath near his ear, and with just that voice — its enough to make Tae weak on his knees, and for tears to fall again. \nJungkook slowly let go of his mouth and faced Tae.—\nEven though Tae was crying and his eyes were blurry, and also the darkness of the place, its still enough for him to see Jungkook’s glistening eyes. \nWas he crying? \n“Hyung...I’m sorry.” He whispered and it cracked. \n“Are you crying?” Tae asked and cupped his face.—\nAnd he confirmed that he’s crying because as soon as he held his face, a tear fell down. \n“I’m sorry...I’m sorry for not talking to you.” Jungkook held his hand on his face. \n“Lisa’s father had his eyes on me. He’s making sure I’m not doing anything against them.”—\n“I had no choice but to avoid you. I’m sorry, I’m really sorry.” He kissed Tae’s palm on his cheeks. \nAnd by that, Tae knew he had a reason. Jungkook would never do that unless something really happened. \nHe trusts him so much, and he’s not regretting.—\n“I understand if you’re mad. You have the right to be. But I just wanted to say sor—“ \nTae immediately aimed for his lips without any hesitation.\nIts been a week, and he missed him so much — they missed each other. \nHow can fate be this cruel to people in love?—\nWhy is it always the ones who’s done nothing? \nWhy does fate needed to put pain in between the sweetness? For a lesson? \nFuck the lesson. I hate the lesson so much. \nWhy can’t it just all be easy? Why can’t we just have peace? How long would we beg for it?—\nThey parted in the kiss even though they did not want it to end. \nThey lean onto each other’s forehead with eyes closed, and hearts hurt. “I understand.”\nTae muttered, but Jungkook knew he’s hurt him. \n“I’m leaving in a few.” \n“Can you promise me one thing?”—\nIt was so sudden, but Jungkook — he’ll do anything for him as to this moment. \n“What is it?” \n“Promise me you’ll&nbsp; come back, alive and healthy.” \nTae’s heart ached at his own words. He’s not sure of whats gonna happen, and he’s so scared.—\nJungkook placed a kiss on his forehead. “I promise,” he paused. <br>“But can u promise me one thing too?”\n“Yes?”\n“Promise me u wont fall in love with anyone while I’m away.” \nTae giggled at his word, “I don’t need to promise. My heart is all yours.”—\nThe moment was a blur, and it was time for him to leave. \n“I know you’ll be worried. So I made something.” Jungkook took out something from his pocket. \nIt was a silver necklace with a hand — who has three fingers up. \n“What does the hand mean?”—\nJungkook placed the necklace around his neck, and its looking so gorgeous on him. \nJungkook did the sign on his hand and showed Tae, “I love you.” \nTae felt quite startled at the sudden words. He felt so happy, and he wanted to cry again in happiness.—\nTae was about to answer when Jungkook heard something from afar. \nIt was Lisa’s father’s assistant. Its calling for him, and its time to go. Jungkook quickly pulled Tae for a hug. \n“Don’t worry about me. I’ll be back for you. I promise.”\n—\nHe placed one last kiss on his lips and left. \nTae felt flustered, his heart was beating so fast and he felt happy. He held onto the necklace and took a look at the hand sign. \nHe kissed the pendant.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/2db241d5514d1a85788d1f4a8a8d49001af7f738/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f46766344713754724774642d42413d3d2d37342e313639343235323735303063623461633332323533393438353131362e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\"He kissed the pendant\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/438b0b3b47da80dfa18a0cf6b4767cf2142ead00/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f386961624c64664a7654414c37673d3d2d37342e313639343235323763333662333164383631333839303334363436312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n"},{"title":"54","data":"255. \nTae stood up from the bed and decided to take some fresh air outside. \nIts December, and its winter. He knew he’ll be cold so he put on his scarf and went out the hallway. \nEverything felt cold, why does Jungkook have to leave when he needs warmth the most?—\nIts already 10, and Tae felt so exhausted by the trainings. But he couldn’t sleep because of the thoughts rummaging his head. \nEven though Jungkook promised, he still can’t get a hold of himself. \nHe sighed and caressed the pendant from the necklace. He smiled.\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/f2e8128deeec007ce260237e4dc2de4748595804/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f6d7542615a3072416f79504450773d3d2d37352e313639343235336139373538396230313237343039313439333431312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\" He smiled\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n257. \nOut of the blue, Tae flinched at the sudden voice from behind. \n“Why are you still awake?” He turned around to see Bogum with his curious emotion. \nHe felt relieved. At least, its not another kidnapper. \n“Obviously, I can’t sleep.” Tae giggled.—\n“You miss Captain already?” Tae felt flustered on what he just said. \nDoes he know? “H-huh?” Tae looked away. \n“Kidding.” Bogum laughed, he knew that was the reason. But he didn’t want to hurt himself any further. \n“Anyways, Captain gave me something.”—\nIt immediately caught Tae’s attention. Bogum took out a box from behind him. Not that small nor big, just average. \n“He gave that to me when he saw me in the camp gate. He told me to give it to you.” \nTae immediately took a hold of the box.—\nHe stared at it and wondered whats inside. He felt nervous. \n“You should unbox it inside. Or in the training room since there are no people there.” Bogum said and left. \nTae immediately went towards the tree where he and Jungkook always meet.—\nHe immediately pulled the ribbon and it revealed not much, but quite enough things for Tae to be endeared. \n“He’s been writing me letters?” He whispered to himself as soon as he saw lots of folded paper with letters engraved on it. \nHe picked one, and read it.\n258. \n— jungkook’s letter to taehyung.\n\n                                <img

We’re just gonna train in the field?” \nTae asked, and Seokjin answered. “Didn’t our trainer told us that we’ll train in waters?” \nTae’s brows shot up, “What?”—\nHoseok grabbed his bag and pulled it over his shoulder. “The trainer told us last week, you didn’t listen did you?” \nThey joked and Tae laughed at himself too. Why is he always missing the important details. \n“Go pack-up now Tae, we’re gonna be called in a few.”\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/24bca39009f870019dab26eb0dbaf70e3eaf12d8/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f72354d36797766633958516937773d3d2d37362e313639343235376237613731636130383635373135393330343638312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"”\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/369536973d022152d94049ae3b2625b29708f74a/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f38577568327038443234485f6b413d3d2d37362e313639343235376331343734643163653239303531383637383332332e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\"265\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n<br>265. \nThey we’re in a forest — again. Well, most unexpected wars happens in forests. \nTae should be used to it already, but he couldn’t since it was a different one for today. \n“Boo!” \n“Holy Mary mother of God—“ \nTae was shut when he heard Bogum laughed.—\n“Why are you praying? Am I something like a bad spirit?” He laughed. \nHe gave him a death glare and pinched his ears. “Aw aw—ouch!” Bogum groaned. \n“Why in the world would you surprise me?” Tae cried, he let go of his ear, and it looked funny cuz it became red.—\nBogum caressed his ear to ease the pain, “You we’re so serious, are you watching for a snake?” \nBy that, Tae remembered what happened last week. He immediately became sensitive with is senses and looked around to see if there are any snakes. \n“No, I’m just preparing my—“—\n“AAA! Snake!” \nBogum cried, everyone became alert and Tae literally jumped from his place. \n“NOTAGAINWHATHEFUCK!” \nHe quickly hid behind Bogum and grabbed the twig beside him as a sheild. \n“WHEREISIT?!” He cried, but he felt so betrayed when Bogum started laughing again.—\nThe other soldiers also felt relieved but betrayed when they heard him laughing. Good thing their trainer hasn’t arrived yet or he’s dead. \nTae smacked his arm. “THAT’S FUNNY? I ALMOST HAD A HEART ATTACK!” He cried. \nBogum was laughing too hard that he choked on his laugh.—\nTae is now the one laughing when he saw Bogum choked. His face looked funny. “Deserved.” \nAfter being calmed down, Bogum chuckled. “Sorry, I was just trying to light up the mood. You look so nervous.” \nTae gulped. He sure was.—\nBogum was quite good at distracting him because he somehow forgot his fears. \nNot long after, their trainer arrived and they immediately went back in their places. \n“As I told you all, our training would be related with water today.” He started.—\n“As you can see, there are three woods on the other side of this edge. In between them was a deep lagoon.” \nThey started distributing arrows and bows to everyone. \n“You’ll be needing to jump onto the lake, but you need to shot atleast one of those wood as soon as you jump.” https://t.co/HAgqoKIHrz—\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/4453ec0bfcedbddd67e4a81461239d86bb1dd406/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f73353548634d364c3177486968773d3d2d37362e313639343235646663616533616638323433383630373138373637312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"1778\" data-original-height=\"1000\" alt=\"“You can use some vines to swing and guide you in shooting\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n“You can use some vines to swing and guide you in shooting. You can enjoy, but remember that this is a training.” \nThey went off by teams. They started to jump while holding onto the vine to shoot, then let go and fall into the water. \nSome got a shot, some didn’t.—\nIts now their team’s turn, and Tae was nervous than ever. \nSeokjin went first, he was scared too and quite hesitating but he still did it. \n2nd was Hoseok, who’s also scared, but lucky that he got a shot. \nNamjoon was next, he’s fine. But quite clumsy to not get a shot.—\nNext was their other teammates. It was a blur, until it was Tae’s turn. \nHe took a step forward and got a view of how high the edge was. The lagoon was also somehow deep. \nHe’s scared of heights, its not even funny. \nHe gathered all his courage and held onto the vine.—\nHe positioned himself and dared to jump. \nBut he’s been doing those since lots of seconds ago, and his trainer was growing impatient. \n“Relax, Taehyung!” He shouted from afar. \nBut that didn’t give courage to Tae, but rather pressure.—\nBogum noticed that he was shaking since he was behind Tae. He suddenly thought of one thing. \n“Do you have thalassophobia?” He asked, and Tae didn’t even lie, \n“Yes.” \nAnd now, Bogum got why he’s this scared. \n“You can do it Tae!” Hoseok encouraged from below.— \n“Taehyung, do you trust me?” \nTae immediately turned to him with teary eyes. His brows we’re furrowed due to frustration. \n“Why would you ask that now—“ \n“Do you trust me? Its a yes or a no.” \nTae doesn’t know what he’s planning, but his mind is a mess now. \n“Yes.”—\nBogum quickly pulled him by his waist, Tae’s back can feel his body from behind. He can even hear Bogum’s breathing. \n“As soon as I jump, shoot your arrow.” Bogum said, Tae felt quite confused. \n“Huh?—AH!” He was surprised when Bogum lifted him up and they jumped together.—\nDue to shock, Tae didn’t get to shot his arrow. Instead, he just held onto Bogum’s arms and let the water engulf them. \nAs soon as they arose from the water, the other soldiers were somehow laughing and smiling. He didn’t know if he should be ashamed.—\n“That’s nice team work. But you both need to do it again because you didn’t get to shoot on the wood.” The trainer ordered. \nTae sighed and immediately hopped out of the water with his wet clothes. \nThey went up again the edge, but this time, Tae had some courage.—\nHe positioned himself and held onto the vine. “Tae, do you want me to jump with you?” \nBogum felt worried, he understood his phobias. Tae looked back and gave him a thankful smile. “Its alright.” \nTae took a deep breath and let himself swung.—\nAs soon as he reach the middle, he let go of the vine and pulled his bow&nbsp; &amp; arrow. \nAnd he got to shot the wood. \nHe fell onto the water, and everyone was clapping, “Great job, next!” The trainer ordered. \nEven though he’s shaking, he’s proud of himself.\n\n      <img

He was closing the door and he did not see Tae behind him. \n“Sssssss.” Tae said, and Bogum immediately jumped in fear. \nBut as he looked back, he saw Tae laughing at him w/his eyes reaching the heavens.—\n“Hah! Finally, some revenge.” Tae muttered, and Bogum is still catching his heart in surprise. \n“Should I congratulate you?” He talked back and started walking towards the camp gate. Tae followed him. \n“Sure, but I just wanted to thank you for helping me out yesterday.”—\nSome soldiers are also going out, maybe going home to their families, or maybe going to some dates? \nWhatever, they’re free on weekends. \n“It’s nothing. I understand your phobias since I have that too.” Tae felt quite interested. \n“You have thalassophobia too?”—\nThey’re finally out of the camp, just walking down the streets with busy people minding their business. \nBogum nodded, “Yeah, but I got to conquer it.”\n“How? It’s quite too hard for me.” Tae said, he thought of the ocean and he immediately had chills. \nHe hated the ocean.—\n“Of course it’s hard at first. But I tried exposing myself often infront of seas and oceans. I also swam when I had courage. So far, my phobia isn’t that worse now.” \nTae nodded, he’s really brave. Maybe he should try that, but even just the thought of sea gives him chills.— \n“How about we try it again?” Tae said out of the blue. It caught Bogum’s attention and he stopped on his tracks. \n“You wan’t to try yesterday’s training again?” He asked and Tae nodded. \n“Yeah, maybe I can conquer my fears too.”\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/b7cc3187f13edf6a181a8f9e3486480a85ce9069/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f7342707564734c6f4378587177673d3d2d37372e313639343438356135653764326139643636353337373434383533302e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\"271\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n271. \nThey both went back to the forest from yesterday. \nEven though they’re still both in fear about the presence of snakes, Tae was too stubborn for Bogum to say ‘no’. \nThey’re both at the edge above the lake, and just by the view, Tae felt scared again.—\n“Are you sure you wanted to do this?” Bogum asked in a worried tone, he can see Tae shaking a little. \n“Yeah, I’m not backing out. Why? Are you scared?” Tae challenged, and Bogum clicked his tongue. \n“You’re challenging me now?”—\nTae shrugged his shoulders and let out a playful smile. He just wanted to enjoy and at the same time calm his fears. \nBut he was startled when Bogum started to take off his shirt, revealing a nice and toned body. \nHe was frozen, out of words. What the fuck.—\n“Should I go first? Or should I guide you again?” He asked, but Tae couldn’t look straight. \n“I-I can do this! You can go first if you want!” He gathered all his strength to look at him...\nIN THE FACE. Yeah, just the FACE.—\nBogum jumped, not holding onto the vine. And it’s quite amazing for Tae, because as for someone like him who has phobias in deep waters, he conquered it quickly. \nAnd maybe, if Bogum can, then he can too. \nBogum reached the water with a huge splash around.—\nHe rose from the water and wiped the water from his face, then looked up to Tae. \n“You can do it!” He encouraged. \nWithout thinking, Tae immediately held onto the vine and swung over, then he let it go to dive right onto the water.—\nHe rose up the water only to hear Bogum laughing in joy, “Great job!” He praised. \nTae ran his fingers through his hair and wiped the water from his face. “Sure is!” He cried and laughed. \nBogum’s eyes suddenly landed onto something where it shouldn’t.—\nTae went up on the rocks beside the lake. The water level is just right on his waist. \nHis clothes were wet that’s why It’s hugging onto Tae’s figure, and its thin enough for Bogum to see through. \nBogum immediately looked away and gulped. He shouldn’t have agreed with this.—\nThe damn waist, that sexy back &amp; that cake — oops! Eyes closed. \nHe distracted himself by diving down then rose up again. His heart was beating so fast, and he hated it. He hated it so much. \n“I’m gonna try it one last time.” Tae cried and went back up the edge.—\nIt was quite dangerous for him to look up, but luckily Tae’s clothes weren’t tight on his figures now. \nPhew. \nHe smiled and lifted a thumbs up to make sure that Tae is encouraged. \n“How about don’t hold on the vine? Just a try?” He suggested.<br>—\nTae thought about it, he felt so scared since he’s not so sure about it. \n“Huh? But I’m scared—“ he was surprised when he saw Bogum right on his side. \nThe fucking water was dripping down his body, holy shit. \n“S-Since when did you get up here?” Tae cried.—\n“You look scared, I’ll guide you first then you jump on your own.” \n“Okay—WAIT—AAH!” He was surprised when Bogum suddenly held his close and lifted him, then they dove together into the lake. \nTae immediately rose as soon as he gathered strength.—\nHe splashed water onto Bogum, “You can’t just do that! I thought I was gonna die!” He cried. \nBogum laughed at his cute reaction. “Things are better when unplanned.” He splashed back and Tae flinched. \n“Oh so you’re the one challenging me now?” He let out a cocky smile.—\nHe splashed back, until they’re just enjoying slapping the water and splashing it to each other. \nLaughs and giggles echoed through the surroundings of the lake. \n“Okay, okay, stop.” Tae cried and he’s almost in tears because of laughing too hard.—\nIt was quite odd, and its nothing special. \nBut for Bogum, Tae looked so beautiful. His hair was messy, and the ends we’re meeting his face so gracefully. \nHis face looked radiant and he looked alot amazing when he smiles. \nHis laugh was music for his ears.—\nAnd he was glad that Tae did not notice. And he should never. \nBecause he didn’t want to mess up his feelings, and he didn’t want to mess up with Captain. \nOne sided love I guess? \nIt’s enough for him that they’re friends, but he’s sad that there can’t be more.—\nThey dried themselves first and started walk again towards their own houses. \nTae’s clothes we’re still wet, but its not that obvious since Bogum let him wear his cardigan because he might get a cold. \nOn their way, Bogum stopped on his tracks. “Oh shit.”—\n“Why?” Tae asked and looked at the direction where Bogum is looking. \nHe was startled when Bogum pulled him behind a wall and told him to quiet. “Shhh, I just saw my younger brother. I think I’ll finally catch him with his girlfriend.” \nHe said and peeked behind the wall.—\nTae peeked too due to curiosity. “Oh, I think that’s his girlfriend.” \nTae furrowed his brows to see clearer. “Yeah I think so too. The girl looks familiar...” he muttered. \nAnd it hit him hard when he realize that she’s really familiar. \nIts Jennie, his younger sister.—\nTae’s eyes immediately bawled. “What the fuck.” He muttered and went out the hiding place, Bogum looks startled. \n“JENNIE!” Tae shouted, and it caught the twos attention. Jennie looks so doomed. \n“T-Taehyung-ssi?” She stuttered.\n"},{"title":"57","data":"—\nHe immediately pulled his sister by her ear, “You, you, you! You little miss ‘sit still look pretty’!”\n“Ouch!” Jennie cried and massaged her ear. “You had a boyfriend already on your age!?” He cried. \n“HE’S NOT MY BOYFRIEND!...yet.” Tae smacked her in the arm.—\n“Then you’re just flirting? You’re too young for this! You need to finish your studies!” \n“But Jimin is nice! He’s not gonna do anything, and I like him!” \nTae was shut by her words. He was frozen on his place when he realized one fucking thing. \n“His name is Jimin?”—\nJennie smiled and nodded. “Yeah! He has a nice name right?” She giggled. \nTae looked back to see the boy, Bogum was scolding him too. \nBut he was so in shock when finally connected the dots.\n\n                                <img

\n<br>277. \nIt was Sunday, and he had nothing to do since Jungkook isn’t around, he has no one to investigate on. \nSo he just went outside, and probably visit someone? He felt so bored and he can’t just sit there in the corner and wait for Jungkook.—\nHe was in the capital market. It’s very crowded, and lots of things are happening. Business, selling things, eateries and other stores. \nHe’s been here before, but he did not memorize the places around. So its easy to say,\nThat he’s quite lost.—\nNot really lost, he just can’t find the way he wanted to go. \nBut luckily, after some minutes of looking around, he finally found him. \n“Bogum!” He shouted and waved at him as soon as they met gazes. \nBogum smiled and waved back, he wasn’t expecting Tae here.—\nHe went towards their stall as soon as he got the chance to get out of the crowd. \n“What brings you here?” Bogum asked while preparing the potatoes in front of the stall. \nTae was right, he was here since he told him that he works here every weekends.—\n“Nothing, I got a bit bored. Can I help?” \nBogum’s eyes bawled at his words, “You wanted to help? Are you used at this? You look like you’re being fed with a golden spoon.” He joked, and Tae shrugged. \n“I’m not used, but I can try. If its okay?”—\nSuddenly, a woman who looks like in her 40s came out from the stall. Bogum immediately stood up. \n“This is my mother, Heena. Mom, this is my friend, Taehyung.” His mother’s mouth flung open in surprise.\n“Taehyung? Kim Taehyung? The son of the general?”—\nTae flashed a smile and nodded. “Oh my! You really looked handsome as to what my son said—“ \nBogum immediately meddled in the conversation in embarrassment. \n“HAHA! My mom’s a comedian isn’t she?” \nHe laughed off and his mom have him a look. “Why? Its true—“—\n“Mommmm...” Bogum said and flashed his eyes at his mom. Heena laughed a bit. \n“Mrs. Park, I wanted to help selling. If its okay for you?” He asked politely and Heena was quite stunned. \n“Are you sure about that?” She asked, and Tae nodded with a smile.—\nAs soon as that, Heena told him to just help Bogum on preparing the potatoes in the front of the stall. \nIts just 9AM, and more people will come as time pass by. “Did you guys plant this?” \nTae asked while putting the potatoes on the wooden tray.—\n“Yeah, but some came from our suppliers.” \nBogum lowkey watched Tae arrange the potatoes. He really looks eager to help, and he’s not even complaining at the heat. \nMaybe, that’s what’s attracting Bogum — his sincere personality.—\nFrom afar, Bogum saw some kids playing and throwing some rocks. \nHe was just gonna let it slide but not until he saw a sharp rock flying towards Taehyung’s direction. \nHis senses immediately moved and pulled Taehyung to the side.—\nBefore Bogum could react, the sharp edge of the small rock met his face and it created and long scratch on his cheeks down to his jaw. \n“Ouch...” he cried, he could’ve avoided it too, but If he did, Tae would trip since he’s holding onto his arm.—\n“Oh my! You kids, you better find another place to play!” Heena shouted and it quickly shooed the kids away. \n“Oh no, I’m so sorry. You could’ve just pulled me!” Tae cried and inspected the long scratch. \n“Are you both okay? Those kids are really getting on my nerves!”—\n“We’re okay mom—“ \n“What do you mean, you’re not!” Tae insisted. “You should go home for now and cure your wound.” \nBogum wanted to fight back and tell that its not needed but Tae agreed too. \n“You’re mom is right. Let’s go cure it first.”\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/eb0b9607889b1ca059fa966bb61aaee7d66ed490/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f7a6844777641327a6e54737770773d3d2d37382e313639343438653764313332646237393933333637343231383538342e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\"”\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/f94d11f0f32f5f1eb9f3c657ee4772bc0e5c95a6/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f38702d6d376d6a306f6e6d6d42513d3d2d37382e313639343438653831316136393161323339363331303233303236322e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n"},{"title":"58","data":"279.\n“Aw—ouch! Can you do it gently—aH!” \nBogum complained while Tae was damping the cloth onto his wound. “Its gentle. Its just that it’s really painful.” Tae said and poured another drop of the medicine. \n“Why do you always save me?” He asked quitly.—\nThat was just one simple question, but Bogum couldn’t find the answer to it. \nWhy is he always saving him when he’s in the state of trouble? Why? Why? \nHis head is aching by trying to find answers. Even though he knew, he couldn’t tell him. \n‘Cuz I like you.’ He thought.—\n“I don’t know, you look awful.” He joked and Tae immediately pressed the cloth on the wound. \n“AH! I WAS KIDDING!” He cried in pain and Tae smirked. “Deserved.” \nAfter curing the wound, there’s now a leave sticking onto his side jaw as a herbal medicine.—\n“You can remove it after 3 hours.” He said and gathered all the things back into the kit. Good thing they have a first aid. \n“Three hours? This leaf is gonna stay in my flawless face?” He asked, and Tae rolled his eyes. \n“Where? Can’t see.”—\nThey both laughed. After fixing things, they both stood up at the same time. \nBut since Tae was a bit clumsy, and floor was too shiny and slippery, Tae lost balance of his own body. \nBut he didn’t fell on the floor. What happened was worse.—\nHe slipped and his body stumbled towards and not backwards. \nMaybe it was just a curse that his lips accidentally met Bogum’s cheeks. \nIt met in milliseconds. But even though it was fast, it was enough to make them both frozen.—\nTae immediately stepped back in shock, and Bogum was still frozen in his place. \n“I-I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it I swear! I slipped and it j-just happened to be l-like that!” Tae explained and he was cursing himself for stuttering. \n“I-Its okay. It was an accident.”—\nBogum gathered himself to speak, and atleast, it lessened the nervousness that Tae was feeling. \nTae quickly put the kit on the table. “I-I’ll just wait outside.” He said and left, closing the door. \nAnd as soon as that, Bogum fell weak on his knees.—\nHe was staring at the blank space his his heart beating so fast. \nHe ran fingers through his hair and let out a deep sigh. \n“Captain please come back already. I don’t know if I can hold back any longer...”\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/55e44bec5fcd3dd4dcd7513eabbb07ab6db558e2/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f525453796150324a49574a624f773d3d2d37392e313639343439303733383637613237643335343637373137303135362e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"794\" alt=\"”\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/612a0bf8f02f4bd4157967d82b4e9782118ba3c0/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f5335586b74307931314a665231773d3d2d37392e3136393434393037373866646637646533303933353739343338362e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"494\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/a990253c73c885ed21a045f4f38e119dc359c79b/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f3570653743394b526a78763653413d3d2d37392e313639343439303832613235633031353932383733323434303530312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"898\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/3f79f8fa0827af020f4dadceec2d3f8c02c25895/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f33645972396d5f5a48444e5571413d3d2d37392e313639343439303839653261613935613434323435373734343334352e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"282\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n<br>282. \nTae suddenly jumped in surprise, even tho there’s nothing to be surprised about. \nIts just Bogum greeting him, what about it? “Hi.”\nHe was behind Tae, but he thought it was funny since Tae isn’t facing him back. \n“Hello.” His voice was shaky. He looked nervous?—\n“My wound is fine. I put a wrap on it.” Bogum said, while trying to find an angle to see Tae’s face. \n“Good. Continue to cure it.” Tae said and went outside their room. It was 4 in the morning, just an hour before their morning cal. \nBogum followed him.—\n“Are you okay?” He asked. “Yes.” \n“Where are you going?” , “Here.” \n“Why aren’t you looking at me?” \nWith that question, Tae couldn’t find an answer. He knew the answer tho, its just that he doesn’t know how to answer. \n“O-Of-course not! Why would I?”—\n“Then why aren’t you looking at me?” \nTae cursed himself mentally. He should’ve been more careful, he should’ve not went out yesterday, and the incident wouldn’t happen. \n“That’s nonesense.” \n“Look at me.” Bogum said, Tae was just standing frozen.—\nTae gathered all his courage and faced him, they immediately met gazes and within just 0.5 seconds, Tae looked away. \nHe remembered it again. \nBogum giggled. “Are you still thinking about the kiss?” \nTae’s face became even red. “No! Shut up.”—\nTheir trainings started, it was a normal day for all of them. Until in the noon, an announcement was heard. \n“The president announced the arrival of American military soldiers. They’ll pay a visit, so gather yourselves as we go to the plaza.”—\nTae’s ears immediately rose as he heard ‘American’. He’s not trying to be xenophobic, but as to what the history wrote, he’s not liking it. \nHe grew worried and suddenly, Jungkook popped in his thoughts. And he can never be more scared.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/5d07d96877a95d7e15c143ddb76f91413bbe88a4/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f6b7a3159705a68367438457573673d3d2d37392e313639343439313663613934383439613137333038343834353132392e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\" And he can never be more scared\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n284.\nThe soldiers arrived at the plaza, where most of the hosting gatherings happen. \nThe people around are also excited since seeing people from a different country was quite new for them. \nMaybe, Tae is the only one who isn’t excited at all.—\n“Hey, isn’t this exciting?” Bogum nudged him on the side, he just let off a smile as an answer. \nNot long after, people’s murmurs started to get loud as a couple of callesa went in the way. \nThere goes General Kim, along with the unfamiliar faces which are the Americans.—\nTae and his father immediately met gazes, and even tho the two weren’t in good terms, this isn’t the right place for Tae to expose him. \nThere was this one tall man, with two guys on both his sides. You can really tell that they’re Americans.—\nAll of the soldiers immediately saluted, then bowed in chorus. “Welcome to South Korea.”\nIt was nice hearing them in harmony. \n“Thank you for welcoming us. As soon as were done in the inspection, we’ll donate some fire arms in your camp.”—\nThey actually went here to see if they can help give some guns, arrows and anything for battle in the Korean military. \nThat was quite kind of them. \nThe guy spoke some few more words, he’s a five-star General, which is the highest position in the military.—\nAfter some speech, Tae’s father called him in the front. He went forward and bowed to the visitors. \n“This is my son, Kim Taehyung. I see that It’ll be good for you to meet him.” He said and they shook hands. \n“Nice meeting you Taehyung, I’m General Walker.”—\nTae smiled while shaking hands with him. He had no words, he’s still a bit suspicious of them even tho there’s nothing to be suspicious at all. \nIt was a few chatting until they heard a loud explosion not far from the plaza. \nPeople started to shout and run in panic.—\nThe explosion started to turn louder as it went near them. \n“Evacuate the people!” Lieutenant Lee shouted but he was inaudible for the soldiers because of the loud explosions. \nTae was panicking, he couldn’t breathe well, but he think he’s fine.—\nHe immediately ran to the people and helped the other soldiers guide them onto somewhere safe. \nThere are children and babies who are crying in fear, and his heart was aching. \nBut everything went worse when some people in black suits showed up and started shooting bullets.—\nAnd you know what sucks? The trainees are not armed, they have no guns with them! \nSome soldiers got shot, some were fighting the people on black physically. \nThe visitors were told be evacuated, but they started shooting too and fought the people in black suits.—\nSome American soldiers in the place are also helping protect the people, and luckily they have their guns with them. \nTae felt so useless — the Korean soldiers felt so useless. \nIts their country, its their people, but they can’t even do anything?—\nTae heard a loud cry from behind him, but he couldn’t tell since there are lots of people behind him. The soldiers were forming a circle around the people to cover them from the bullets. \nTae saw a little child almost being stepped on, and he’s crying so bad.—\nTae ran into the crowd and helped the poor kid. He immediately got familiarized with him. “Taehyuk?” Its the kid from the arcades. \nHe immediately hugged Taehyung and cried hard. “Sir—my friend got shot.” \nTae’s heart broke at his words.\n"},{"title":"59","data":"tw // blood &amp; child death ‼️<br>— pls skip the next chapter if youre sensitive in this topic—\nThe kid pulled him onto the side, they dove into the sea of people. \nOn the shallow side of the street, was a kid lying down, he’s was diving in his own blood. And he’s obviously...dead. \nAnd that kid, was Minhyuk. The kid who reminded Tae of Jimin.—\nTear started falling from his cheeks as soon as he saw Taehyuk kneeling down, and hugging Minhyuk. \n“Minhyuk-ah, please wake up. You’re not dead yet right? Aunt Min is wrong right?” He cried while patting him to wale him up.\nTae felt so angry.—\nIt was just little kid, who dreamed of being successful in life. He’s done nothing, and he could’ve had a bright future. \nHe doesn’t deserve this, no one does. \nBut all Tae can do right now is to help people to not get shot, and cry in anger.—\nNot long after, the shootings went off. And the explosions were gone. Finally. \nBut even after that, it left such a huge scar on everyones heart. \nLots of people are lying down in the street, some were dead, some were in between the line of life and death.—\nLots of houses are destroyed, even some structures. \nCries and screams of people were making Tae deaf, and it pains his heart to witness this. \nHe saw Namjoon from afar, a soldier on his arms. And Tae felt so scared to know who it was.—\n“Hoseok, he’s dead...” Namjoon muttered, his eyes tearing up. Tae felt weak on his knees. \nHe couldn’t take all the tragedies that happened today. And its just one day, what’s going to happen next? \nHe looked around, and he felt so drained in what he’s seeing.—\n“Why did this happened? Why are the trainees not armed? If they are then my son wouldn’t have died!” A mother cried and hugged his son who is covered in blood. \n“Where is Captain Jeon? Isn’t he supposed to be the one taking care of this?!” A person from afar cried.—\n“Yes! Where the fuck is Captain? He’s so irresponsible!” \n“If then, he shouldn’t be a Captain at all! My family died!” \nPeople started blaming Jungkook around, and Tae can never be more hurt. \n“Don’t say that!” Tae stood up. “He cares about us!” He said.—\nBut on the other side, Tae also thought about it. \nWhy does it have to happen when he’s away? Why is he nowhere to be found when he’s needed the most? \nHe fell weak on his knees and let his tears fall. He couldn’t bear the pain he’s feeling in his heart anymore.\n\n                                <img

\n"},{"title":"60","data":"290. \nAll the soldiers saluted as the dead bodies of the killed trainees gets buried. \nEverything felt so dull. The families of the victims we’re mourning over their loved ones.\nIt was all crying, and it felt so painful for Taehyung to see this.—\nHe wondered that what if...what if he dies too? Would there be someone who’ll cry over him? \nAs soon as the ceremony ended, the trainer gathered them around and told them that there would be no trainings for this day as a respect to those who lost.—\nIt was already sunset, and Taehyung was sitting up in the rooftop their building.\nIt was quiet, and peaceful. But he can feel his heart breaking onto pieces. \nHe doesn’t know why he’s sad. Maybe because of a death? Maybe because of frustration? Maybe.—\nOr maybe because he knew he trashed history. \nHe hated it, so much. He said its boring, he said its no fun. He said its just a waste of time. \nBut now that he’s here, right in the moment of the history, he knew he was to cruel to say that.—\nHe stood up to have a better view of the sunset. \nThe colors were arguing to red, orange and yellow. But even with that quarrel, it comforted Tae through the deepest part of his heart. \n“Jungkook...” he murmured as the wind brush his face. “I miss you...”—\nWith that words, he couldn’t help but shed a tear. \nFor him, Jungkook looks like home. Jungkook smells like home. Jungkook feels like home.\nHe’s his rest in this stressful world. \nBut where is he, in this time where Tae needs a hug, and comfort the most?—\nHe grabbed the necklace that Jungkook gave him, and held onto the pendant. \n“I’m still wearing the necklace you gave me. And I’ll wear this even on my death.” He muttered and kissed the pendant. \n“Wherever you are, I hope you still have the same feelings for me.”—\n“Taehyung?”\nA familiar voice spoke from behind, Tae immediately wiped his tears. \nHe turned around, but right before he could recognize who it was, that person pulled him into a hug. \nWell, a hug that Tae needs. \n“Thank goodness, you’re safe.”—\nTae immediately recognized the voice. “Bogum?” He spoke. \nThey broke the hug, and he saw Bogum’s eyes were puffy &amp; swollen.&nbsp; “You were crying?” Tae asked. \nBut Bogum just laughed and sat on the floor. “What do you mean?” \nTae sat beside him. https://t.co/akDt6sgS7X\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/f1a1b1fbe3b9c840d228555485371883be9fd0d9/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f2d5a666541457532515a326373773d3d2d38312e313639343439393638326337313834333834373135373839343730392e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"1920\" data-original-height=\"1440\" alt=\"co/akDt6sgS7X\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n—\n“Your eyes were swollen.” Tae said and looked to the side to see Bogum. \n“No, I told you I’m strong!” He flashed his muscles and laughed. But luckily, Tae can read eyes. \n“Hey...even the strongest metal in the world lost against the fire.”—\nWith those words, Bogum lowered his head, and Tae heard him sniffing. \nHe’s crying. The person who said he’s the strongest is now crying.\nTae went silent and nodded, “I’m listening.” He said. He’s not good in words, but maybe at listening.—\nBogum was crying, but he was still holding back from bawling. \nTae could feel the pain in his sobs, and the longer he listen to it, the more it gets painful. \n“I can’t believe I lost Hoseok hyung...” he said in between his sobs.—\nBogum was fidgeting with his fingers, and he was clenching his fists in frustration. \n“He’s more than just a friend to me. We knew each other since we were kids, and he’s like a big brother to me.” \nBogum paused to calm himself down.<br>—\nBogum was fidgeting with his fingers, and he was clenching his fists in frustration. \n“He’s more than just a friend to me. We knew each other since we were kids, and he’s like a big brother to me.” \nBogum paused to calm himself down.—\n“He’s always there whenever I need him or not. I wouldn’t need to utter a word because he already knows if I’m sad. He wouldn’t ask If I’m okay, he’ll just randomly tell his jokes and do silly things until I’m already laughing.”—\n“He used to protect me especially when I was getting bullied. I promised myself that I’ll protect him too but now? I wasn’t even by his side when he got shot.” \nTae felt even sadder about what he’s hearing. Hoseok was a wonderful person, and he sure doesn’t deserve that.—\n“Who’s gonna tell me jokes now? Who’s gonna make me laugh when I’m sad now? I’ll never hear his laugh again, never.” \nBogum’s tears we’re continuously falling down. His fists were clenching so hard to the point that his nails are buried onto his hands. \nIts bleeding.—\nTae gently placed his hand above Bogum’s. He grabbed it and opened it to prevent it from bleeding further. \nTae intertwined their fingers to prevent him from clenching it again. \n“I know I’ll never understand your pain. But I wanted to let you know that you have me.”—\nTae flashed a sincere smile, and Bogum calmed down from his cries. \nHe looked at their hands, and atleast, it made him happy — knowing that he still has someone who cares from him. \nHe held back Tae’s hands and smiled. “Thank you.”—\nThey stayed like that for awhile, talked about a lot of things. \nTae tried to pull out his best humor, and atleast, he heard Bogum laughing. \nAfter some while, Tae remembered something. \n“Hey...can you accompany me onto somewhere?”—\nAs he agreed, it took them minuted to finally reach the place where Tae wanted to go. \nIt was in the house of Minhyuk, the boy who died. \nIn front of their house were flowers, and there are people outside, maybe their relatives. \nHe can also hear crying inside.—\nTae went inside, only to see the Minhyuk’s mother crying over the coffin of his son. \nNot long after, the mother calmed down and turned around. Tae caught her attention. \n“Who are you? Why are you here?” The mother asked.—\n“I-I’m Minhyuk’s friend. He’s a really good kid, I’m here to share my condolences.” \nThe mother nodded, but It wasn’t over yet. “Wait, I think I know you...” \nTae felt nervous. “Aren’t you that trainee who defended Captain?”—\nTae doesn’t know how to react, he doesn’t know if thats a good or not. \n“Yes, thats him!” A woman shouted. \n“He’s on Captain’s side!” \nPeople started shouting at him and their words were too harsh for Tae. They were cornering him and his panic attack is attacking again.—\n“How dare you come here!? Its that Captain’s fault of why my son died!” The woman started throwing hands on Taehyung and he was shaking \nBogum immediately dove into the crowd and went in front of Tae to block the hits. \n“Stop it!” Bogum cried.—\n“He’s not here for a fight. And you, Ma’am, I don’t want to sound disrespectful but do you think causing a fight in your son’s death is good?” \nEveryone went quiet. \n“Again, we share our condolences with you. And we will do our best to get the justice everyone deserves.”<br>—\nWith those words, they left the room.\nThey went back to the camp, but they just stayed behind it since Tae was still bawling in tears. \nThey were in the park where Tae and Lisa mer before, they had more privacy there.—\n“Tae, it’s not your fault okay?” Bogum comforted. Tae was still shaking in shock. \n“Am I that bad because I defended Captain?” Tae asked, but even Bogum, couldn’t answer it. \n“They knew nothing, and if only they knew, they wouldn’t be like this. He’s their saviour.”—\nTae was taken a back by his words, he just realized what he said. \n“Saviour? What do you mean? Does Captain have something to do with this?” Bogum asked. \nTae couldn’t find the right words to say. How is he gonna tell him that he’s from the future?—\n“Uh no, Its nothing. I’m probably just tired, sorry.” Tae said and stood up. \nHe wiped his tears. “Lets go back in, its already late.” He said. \nAnd even though Bogum did not asl anymore, he knew something was going on. \nWhat does Tae meant?\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/a5e39f86306aa936c5fe5d730c878d9c9990d40b/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f475445323850676146465f545f513d3d2d38312e313639343439646233613738653061633639323832393835323535352e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\"What does Tae meant?\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/ae2af5b4c10607ae8c69a292d9797a77bf7e12b6/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f43465361684e6244674b496355413d3d2d38312e313639343439646262333765396132383338333538353938343438352e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/ed9c283ff60ee50fb1ec10b4fafec9b2258ff92a/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f6b7962395f69704854634a306d673d3d2d38312e313639343439646332663139333765343438363137363836343030392e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/5f6b843dd3afa31b9ff2d7a0bcd0bffc37ac0b94/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f6b35716c6c37776e4d47614f75513d3d2d38312e313639343439646364313435333336343631333832343636383337302e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/b7290210bc0ac5f8116946423420d55e59cb3acd/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f4b52785863394b4b316c66615f673d3d2d38312e313639343439646435383634303736613633393239393232383137322e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n"},{"title":"61","data":"293. \nIts been 2 days since the incident happened. But despite of that, so many things changed in the camp. \nThe number of soldiers became less, and the once lively atmosphere was gone. \nAnd Tae can never be used to it, and Bogum was not was same anymore. He rarely smiles now.—\nHe understood why, losing a friend who you’ve grown up with is really hard. \nHe knew the feeling since he felt like he lost Jimin too because of being in a different era. \nAnd thats not what changed only, a huge changed happened.—\nThe American Captain — Hugo Walker came yesterday, and the General proclaimed him as one of the temporary supervisors of this camp while Jungkook is away.\nThe trainings became intense because of that, and its just the start of the day but theyre tired already.—\nIt was lunch break, they were in their rooms eating. \nBut you know, the soldiers still wanted to bring back the happy atmosphere back then. Some of them are starting to laugh and open up again. \nBut Bogum...he felt new for Tae. He’s been so quiet.—\nNamjoon caught Tae’s attention, but he did not call him tho — the stares of Namjoon on Seokjin was quite interesting for Tae. \nBecause maybe, he knew how different a STRAIGHT stares. \n“Hey...” he whispered to Bogum who was eating quietly beside him.—\nHe’s still not taking his eyes off Namjoon. “Hmm?” Bogum answered. \n“What do you think about Namjoon &amp; Seokjin hyung?” Bogum was quite surprised at Tae’s question. \nHe looked at him and inspected his expressions. He saw that he was looking at Joon so he looked at him too.—\n“What do you mean by that?” Bogum asked and Tae thought. \n“Do you think Namjoon hyung likes Seokjin hyung?” Tae asked. \nThe way Namjoon follows Seokjin by his eyes, and the way he randomly smiled when Seokjin is around was too obvious for him. \nOr maybe it was just him?—\n“Like? As a friend?” Tae shook his head. “You know what I meant.” \nBogum took a look again at Namjoon, and thats where he understood what Tae was talking about. \n“Are you trying to tell me that Joon hyung has feelings for Seokjin hyung?” He asked.—\nTae nodded with a smile, he hit the bulls eye. “Yeah!” He cried. \n“I mean look at him, from his eyes you can tell that he’s inlove.” Tae lowkey pointed at Namjoon who was smiling while talking to Seokjin. \n“But a guy with a g...” Bogum did not continue what he was gonna say.—\nBecause he should be asking himself that. He liked Taehyung, even if he’s a guy. So why would he ask about that? \nTae realized that things like that aren’t normal here. So he understood why Bogum was quite confused. \n“Yeah, I think so.” Bogum changed his answer.—\nTae smiled, atleast he had someone to fanboy around. Jimin and him used to do this — watching students around and pinning them onto people that they thought suits them. \nTae sighed with a smile, by looking at Namjoon...does Jungkook look at him like that too?—\nWho knows? He’s never seen him looking at him, but somewhere in his heart...he knew he does. \n“Trainees,” A soldier staff spoke onto the megaphone that echoed through the camp. \n“Lieutenant Lee wanted to announce that all of you can take a break for today.”—\nThe soldiers were confused, its just wednesday, why is it their rest day now? \n“You can go out, visit your family and anything. But make sure to be back here before tomorrow.” The speaking ended. \nEven though theyre confused, some went out the camp and did their businesses.—\nSome just stayed in the camp and rested or slept, some just practiced their tactics. \nTae planned on just staying in the camp and maybe sleep too. But he was really bothered for Bogum since he looks so down. \nAnd Tae wanted to do something for him to atleast make him smile.—\n“Hey, get up.” Tae ordered as he stood up. \nBogum looked up with a confused expression. “Why?” He asked, Tae held his arm and pulled him up. \n“Come on, we’re going somewhere.” He encouraged and Bogum finally stood up. But he was still dull tho.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/2a86924b3efdebc0d06b69be1eb11eb41fb623f6/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f6b616244477732347533765853413d3d2d38322e313639343461303963383461643537373533313137323536323136322e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\" But he was still dull tho\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/7d339cf20d01705680cdf4204257308cda6fe43d/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f5455316d514d784845786f6c79513d3d2d38322e313639343461306137343565343437313539303538383634343430392e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/a0d510306dd9a6a37c76b7699602c320a66064cd/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f69343669377942533470575166773d3d2d38322e3136393434613061666135346636373138363736343038333032392e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n<br>295. \n“Jajaaaaaan!” Tae said as they stepped right in the wide amusement park. \nBogum looked around. “Arcades...? You’re really a kid, are you?” He joked. \nTae wanted to smack him, but he went with his joke instead. “Yes, I’m a baby. \n“My baby?” Bogum asked.—\nTae got caught off guard with what he heard, he froze right on his place. “H-Huh?” He asked. \nBogum impishly smiled and shook his head. “Nothing, I asked why we’re here.” \n“O-oh, well you see...” Tae cursed himself for stuttering. Gosh, he lost his focus.—\n“Obviously, were gonna have fun! Lets play games!” He said in a cheering voice. \nBogum smiled a bit and nodded. “Okay.” He got pulled into lots of stalls and rides. \nHe missed being a child, who’s problems are only about toys and playing.—\nWhen Bogum was a kid, he wished to grow up and be an adult because he thought it would be cool and he’ll have a lot of privileges. \nBut now that he’s an adult, he just wanted to back time and became a kid again. \nHe hated being mature...so much.—\nBut he also knew, that kids nowadays are experiencing hardships like how adults do. And he’s more than lucky to not experience that as a kid. \n“What is this?” Bogum asked as Tae pulled him onto another ride. “Its called drop tower.” \n“What does it do?”—\nThey looked up to see how the drop tower works, and just by watching it, Bogum felt nervous already. \nTae felt nervous too, but he wanted to be brave and look cool for now. FOR NOW. \n“T-Tae I d-don’t think this is a good idea.” Bogum let out a nervous laugh.—\nTae smirked, maybe this will let the the energy in him out. “What do you mean? It looks fun!” Tae cried. \n“Hahahaha...” Tae wanted to laugh at Bogum’s nervous laugh. But he’ll just save it for later. \nThey fell in love — oops! I meant line — and waited for their turn.—\nThey were now in the seats of the ride. And Bogum can already feel his insides shaking. \nThe drop tower started going up slowly. “Are you scared?” Taehyung asked Bogum who was beside him. \n“No, I told you I’m strongAAAAAAAAA!”—\nEveryone on the ride screamed when the seats dropped immediately. \nBut Tae couldn’t hold back his laughter since the loudest scream was from Bogum. \n“AAAAAAAAHOLYCHICKENSWHATTHEFUCK!” \nHe was holding tightly onto Tae’s hand who is currently laughing so hard.<br>—\n“No no no, I getting off stop this!” Bogum cried as soon as the seats are rising up again. \nPeople on the ride with them are also laughing because of his words. “You can’t yet!” Tae said. \nThey were holding each others hands to release their fears.—\n“NonononoOAAAAAAAAA!” Bogum screamed again as soon as the seats dropped. \nWhile Tae on the other hand, doesn’t know if he’ll scream of just laugh. \nThat repeated for no on knows how many. But atleast, it ended. \nThey went off the seats and Bogum’s legs were shaking.—\n“Hey, are you okay?” , “Do I look like I’m okay?” \nTae laughed at his answer. His voice was cracking and he was almost tearing up. He looks so traumatized. \n“Why are you looking up?” Tae asked when he saw him looking up the sky. \n“I think I left my soul up there.”—\nTae was laughing so hard that he’s almost crying. \nBogum laughed too, not because of himself, but because of Tae’s laugh. He thinks its funny. \n“Why are you laughing?” Tae asked. “I dont know, you were laughing.” \n“Whats funny?” , “I don’t know, I think were funny.”—\nThey met each other’s gaze and laughed together. They don’t know whats funny this time, but it gets funnier as they think about why they were laughing. \nThey rode a few more rides, until its finally sunset. They did not even realize its already 6.—\n“Hey stand over there.” Tae ordered him while Bogum was busy munching on the grilled meet on stick. \n“Why?” He mumbled since his mouth was full. \nBogum stood with the carousel on his background. Tae took out his phone and opened the camera.\n“Say kimchi!”—\nAnd its just funny since Bogum literally just said the word kimchi. “No, you have to smile.” \n“Oh okay.” Bogum fixed his position, “1...2...3...!”\nHe showed his gummy smile until the camera finally flashed. Tae reviewed the photo and Bogum looks cute.—\nBogum went towards him to see the photo but he was so confused to see an unfamiliar thing on Tae’s hand. \n“What is that?” Bogum asked. “Oh, this is a cellphone.” Bogum furrowed his brows. \n“Its used to take photos.” Tae explained. “Like a daguerreotype?”\n"},{"title":"62","data":"-\nTae was felt familiar of the word, he heard it from somewhere. \"Daguerreotype?\" \n\"Yes, its used to take photos too.

Its obvious that they like each other, why not just go for it?\" \nTae complained while watching Namjoon and Seokjin from beyond. \nHe in the rooftop with Bogum to watch the sunset, and now their topic went back to Joon and Seokjin.-\n\"Yeah. But I think they're having difficulties on confessing, I understand cuz I had some guy I like and...shit.\" \nTae's mouth went agape as soon as he heard Bogum slipped on his words. \n\"Goodness...YOU HAVE A GUY CRUSH?!\" Tae cried.-\nBogum was cursing himself for being so clumsy. How is he gonna get rid of this? \n\"Uh, that's nothing-\" , \"No waaaaayyyy! You have to tell me about him! Come on, come on, come on!\" Tae encouraged. \nBogum scratched the back of his nape. Well shit, he said.-\n\"There's nothing special tho... he just smiled with his eyes, his smile is also cute. And you know what? His features are far from real. He looks too beautiful for the world. And besides that, he has a good heart.\"\nTae felt happy for him, he really in love.-\n\"Whats his name? I wanna meet him! It really looks like he caught your heart.\" Tae teased, and Bogum just smiled. \nHe really has no idea, does he?\" \n\"I don't think you can meet him.\" , \"Why not-\" \n\"Unless you look into a mirror.\"-\nTae laughed, he thought he was joking. \"Why would I look into a...mirror...\"\nTae finally realized what he meant. He was frozen in his place, and he doesn't even know how to react. \n\"Y-You...like me?\" Tae asked, and Bogum nodded. Maybe he had no choice but to say it already.-\n\"Why didn't you tell me?\" Tae asked, he was trying to calm his heart. \nBogum chuckled, but it looks painful this time. He was smiling, but his eyes looks so sad. \n\"How am I gonna have the chance to tell you if all you talk about is Captain?\"-\nTae felt so bad, is he really that numb? \n\"You know, I was the one who gave you extra shirt when you got soaked in the mud. I was the one who bought you food one time where you forgot your lunch. I saved you too from the forest. I was giving you all the hints...\"-\nTae felt a lump on his throat. His heart was breaking, but he knew that Bogum was the one who's more hurt.\n\"But all of my efforts were nonesense, because you liked Captain...not me.\" \nTae's eyes were tearing up. How can he hurt someone whos done nothing but love him?-\n\"I'm sorry...\" thats all what Tae could say. He was really shocked and speechless. \nBogum giggled, \"No, Its not your fault. Its my choice to continue liking you.\" \nBogum wiped the tear from Tae's cheeks. \"Don't cry. Its hurts me.\"-\nAnd even if Bogum asked him to not cry, that just became the reason for him to burst more. \nBecause he knew that he can never love him the way Bogum does. \n\"Can I have your hand?\" Tae did not hesitate and placed his hand beside Bogum's.-\nHe compared their palms. \"Your hands look tiny beside mine.\" He giggled, he thought its cute. \nBut Tae was surprised when Bogum suddenly intertwined their fingers. \"Just let me hold your hand for five minutes...just for five minutes please...\"-\nTae didn'tanswer, but he agrees. He held Tae's hand and placed it right above his chest. His heart was beating so hard.\nLove can be beautiful, but can be cruel too. I know one sided love is frustrating, but doesn't it hurt more when u know that u cant return their love back?\n\n      <img

to ask about the issue. \n“What’s going on?” He asked one of his teammates.—\n“Lietenant Lee is leaving. He got fired from handling this camp because of disobeying the camp rules.” \nLieutenant Lee was one of the longest facilitator of this camp, he’s been serving here for 17 years already, so how can he get fired for doing something against the rules?—\n“What rules did he violate?” \n“Isn’t he the one who let us out yesterday? They say that was the reason.” \nTae nodded and tried to calculate things. Lieutenant Lee would never do such things without any orders from someone who’s higher than him.—\nHe saw Seokjin sitting on the corner, staring on the blank space. He looks so lost in his thoughts that he did not even noticed that Taehyung was standing in front of him. \n“Hyung?” Tae waved his hand in front of Seokjin to get his attention. The elder flinched.—\n“Oh...hey Tae.” Jin greeted as Tae sat beside him. “What are you thinking?” \nTae asked, but Seokjin looked away. “Nothing.” He simply said. But of course, as a graduated lawyer, Tae knew that its not just nothing. \n“It doesn’t look like its just nothing.”—\n“Tell me, I’ll listen.” Tae encouraged, he felt like he had to ask Seokjin about it. \nThe elder sighed, “I was thinking about what I heard...” \nTae’s ears rose at the topic, this kind of mysteries are driving him crazy. “What is it?”[ FLASHBACK ]—\n“Captain Walker, you we’re looking for me?” Lt. Lee saluted as he entered Hugo’s office. \nThe new Captain gave him an inspecting look, then sighed. He seemed frustrated. \n“I just wanted to ask you why you let the trainees out yesterday?”—\nHe was standing behind his desk with his arms crossed. \nWhile on the other hand, Lee was surprised at the question. “Pardon, sir?” He asked, not believing what he heard. \n“I was on the other camp for inspection when a staff here reported that the trainees we’re ——\nout even tho its not yet weekends. Mind explaining that?” \nThe Lieutenant was so confused at his words that he couldn’t even process what he was going to say. \n“S-Sir, you we’re the one who asked me to let the trainees on rest.” Hugo raised a brow. \n“Excuse me?”—\nHugo said, he also got confused at what Lieutenant said. “I never asked you to do it?” \n“But sir, you sent me a letter yesterday stating about that matter. So I immediately sent a staff to announce it in the camp.” \nSilence reigned on the room, but there was still confusion.—\nHugo sat on the chair, trying to process things in his mind. “So you’re saying that I sent you a letter ordering about letting the trainees rest?” \n“Yes sir.” And with his answer, Hugo got more confused. \n“But I never sent you a letter?”—\nLee was surprised, he took out the letter that he was talking about since it was still in his pocket. \n“Isn’t this your hand writing, sir?” He gave the letter to Hugo and the Captain inspected it. \n“It looks so much like my hand writing, but I never wrote this?”—\nGeneral Kim knocked, and went inside the room. “Sorry for meddling in but I heard about the matter,” \nHe faced Lieutenant, “You know how strict the rules are here since you’ve been here for so long. Yet you still violated one.” \nHugo stood up.—\n“General, I don’t think he’s on fault—“ \n“But he still violated the rules, Captain. You also know how strict it is, &amp; even if someone just sent him a false letter, its still his fault since he didn’t make sure it was true.” \nHugo froze on his place as soon as he heard those.—\nHe went silent, but his thoughts were raging. \n“You know it has a consequence right? I’m sorry but as one of the facilitators of this camp, I fire you handling this place.” \nLieutenant’s heart fell at the words, it was really painful for him.—\nImagine being so dedicated and sincere about your work that you started to love it as much as how you loved yourself. \nBut with just one mistake, everything snaps back. \nMaybe, it was really the time for someone to replace him now, since he’s getting old already.—\n“General, why fire him? It was a misunderstanding. Maybe its better if we just relocate him into another camp.” \nHugo suggested, and luckily, Jaewon agreed. “Okay then, we’ll just relocate you. You have until today to pack your belongings.” \nHe said and left.—\n“Captain...you don’t have to do that. I accept the punish—“ \n“No, don’t say that. I heard how much you loved your job, and I’m not letting that one misunderstanding end your love for it.” \nLieutenant felt touched, he showed off an impish smile. “Thank you, Captain.”— \n[ END OF FLASHBACK ]—\nJin told him everything that he heard. And Tae felt nothing but sadness and pity. \n“I’ve known Lieutenant for years, I’ll miss his presence here.” Jin muttered, but Tae knew that something else was bothering him. \n“Are you suspicious about my father?”—\nJin looked down to his feet, he felt uncomfortable talking about it since that was Tae’s father. \n“Don’t worry, I hate him too.” Jin was surprised at his words, he giggled. “What was that for?” He asked. \n“Nothing, just making u comfortable. But I mean it.”—\n“Well, I do kinda feel suspicious about you father...” Jin started. \n“Because he mentioned that someone gave Lieutenant a false letter, but no one even talked about it? So how did he know?” \nTae smirked, he was thinking the same thing. But he wasn’t surprised.—\nCuz he knew now how much of an asshole his father was. \nIn the afternoon, after their trainings, they got called in the field for an announcement. \nIts time for Lieutenant to leave. \nHe gave his speech, and looked at the place for the last time before leaving.—\nEverything felt heavy in the heart. The trainees felt sad about Lieutenant’s departure, since his presence would forever be missed.\n"},{"title":"64","data":"[ TIME SKIP : THE NEXT DAY ]—\nFriday in the morning, Bogum kept biting his lips to prevent himself from smiling. \nHe was carrying a bouquet of — not flowers — but strawberries. He got it from the back of the camp in which he planted a month ago. \nBut his hands were bruised since ——\nHe slipped, but instead of using his hands to prevent himself from stumbling, he used it to save the falling strawberries from being damaged. \nBut the bruise wasn’t bad — its just had he wounded his elbows and knees too. \nClumsy, you say?—\nHe doesn’t mind the bruise since the strawberries we’re on good condition. \nHe picked all the good ones and arranged them in a paper like thing and designed them like a flower bouquet. \nAnd of course, he made it for Tae.—\nSince Tae already knew his feelings for him, he doesn’t ask anything in return, but he told him to just let him love him. \nAnd he’s really happy that he can finally express his feelings freely for him. \nHe finally saw Tae running in the hallway with a smile on his face.—\nHe knew Tae liked strawberries, thats why he prepared these. He immediately hid the bouquet behind him as Tae went further. \n“Hey!” Tae greeted in a happy tone. \n“I have something to tell you.” They both said in same time, then laughed. \n“Okay, you go first.” Bogum said.—\nTae looked so happy, he couldn’t even stop smiling. He stomped his feet on excitement. \n“Okay but I just got the news earlier and guess what?” Tae asked. “What?” \n“CAPTAIN IS FINALLY GOING HOME!” Tae cried and jumped in happiness.—\nBogum felt a thousands of bullets shot him in his heart. He didn’t know how to react, but he just kept his smile. \n“Really? That’s a good news! When is he coming back?” He asked. \n“I don’t know but they said this week. Omygod I’m so happy!”—\nTae gathered himself together. “Anyways, what were you going to say? And what’s that you’re hiding behind you?” Tae asked. \n“Oh I forgot what I was gonna tell you. And this, its just garbage, I was putting some trash out.” He answered. His\nTae nodded, “Okay, see you around!”—\nAs soon as Tae was out from his sight, he took out the bouquet from behind him, and laughed to himself. \n“Why am I even hoping?” His heart was pierced, and maybe he’s used to the pain. \nBut today, he just didn’t had the energy to hide it.\n\n                                <img

Just 3 more weeks on the camp, and theyre finally going to be a soldier. \nAs soon as Tae went in their house, he saw his mom sewing some clothes in the living room. \n“Good morning, mom.”—\nHis mom welcomed her with a hug and gave him a loving peck on the cheek. \nBut of course, as a mother, she can feel that something was odd about her son. \nTae smiles, but he doesn’t smile like today. His smile looks different and that was intriguing for his mom.—\n“It really looks like a good morning for you, huh?” She spoke as she smiled.

How come you’re suddenly interested?” She asked as she cross her arms across her chest.—\nTaehyung thought of an excuse, but he feel bad for lying. “I just wanna do something for a f-friend...” \nHe said, he prayed that his mother wouldn’t ask more, but I guess not. \nValerie raised a brow. “A friend? You’re never like this to your friends...”—\nTae gulped, what can he say more? \nAnd maybe, his mother sensed that Tae was quite shy at the topic. She nodded, “Okay then, I’ll teach you.” \nTae looked like a happy puppy as soon as he heard that. He’s very eager to learn. \nSince this is for Jungkook.—\n“First off,” his mother grabbed two pieces of white cloth for them to practice on. \nThen gave him a needle and a thread. “You have to shoot the thread into the hole of that needle.” \nTae was quite experienced since he learned the basics during middle school.—\nBut thats still not enough for Tae to call himself ‘skilled’.\nIt was really hard shooting that shit of a thread into the hole of the needle. A few salivas helped too tho, and the hard works paid off since he succeeded. \n“That was hard.” Tae commented.—\nAs their lesson went by, and even if tae knew the basics, he still cant help but to get pricked by the needle. \nAnd since he’s in 1890s, thimbles aren’t quite popular yet. Thats why he had a few red spots and some wounds because of it. \n“Can you still do this?”—\nHis mother asked since his fingers were red because of the accidental pricks. \nBut Tae nodded, “Of course.” He really looked determined, and that’s what made his mother smile. \n“You’re really making me happy, honey...” Valerie started.\n“Why?” Tae asked.—\n“Cuz you’re never like this. Back then, you only greet me good mornings and thats all. You never talk or open up to me. I always try to reach out for you but you keep on pushing me away. It’s really worrying me and its making me sad...” \n“But one day, you suddenly changed.”—\nTae felt somehow happy, the real Taehyung really is aloof on his family. \n“You’re suddenly smiling and talking to me for no reason. You tell jokes too. You became more open on whats happening to you and you introduced me your friends. You don’t know how happy I am Tae.”<br>—\n“I...” Tae started, “I just realized nothing will happen if I’ll stay like that.” He lied, he cannot tell her the truth and he felt bad. \n“Captain really made a big impact on you, did he?” His mother asked and Tae smiled. \n“He really did. God, when did I became so inlove?”—\nBut he immediately stopped talking when he realized it. \nHe looked at his mom and she was laughing. “You know the saying, ‘the fish is caught by its own mouth’?” \nHe bit his lip and looked away in embarrassment. How is he so clumsy?—\n“M-mom...forget it...” his mother continued laughing and Tae thought he was funny too.\n“You know,” his mother calmed down from laughing. \n“Even if you don’t tell me, I know that you two have feelings for each other.” \nTae felt butterflies in his tummy. Oh my.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/7505d047bc82e6846ecdb8c6d730cc895b0926f8/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f6f55324b475a5f7336644a375f673d3d2d38362e313639346266646531326338663663303535383730333136363637362e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"548\" alt=\" Oh my\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/39d7d3d0d7f96d3df974bd90f91e3a3a33cd17e5/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f6a664378466e75746d43784f74413d3d2d38362e313639346266646537303733363961623233303739363237383234352e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"548\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/6f71d5a920c4dd1d128ef6915a1a46add62194f3/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f5f3634444965306b325655346e673d3d2d38362e313639346266646566343337613938643732313734373938313936312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/eb1b37afbe3ec594abcdef382fae0bab6dbde9f6/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f576d3771725236336568745936413d3d2d38362e313639346266646637326438396661393536373535363732393732382e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"306\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n<br>306. \nSunday passed, and Tae woke up early to finish the handkerchief that he was sewing for Jungkook. \nHe was sewing a letter ‘J’ on the corner of the cloth, that stands for Jungkook’s name. \nHis fingers were sore, its been bleeding since yesterday because of the needle.—\nBut he doesn’t mind. His hard works paid off since he finally finished sewing at noon. \nHe took a look at it, and he felt proud about it. Just imagining Jungkook’s reaction about it was giving him butterflies. \n“Are you possessed?”—\nHe saw Jennie standing in the corner, holding a holy cross with her scared expression. \nTae raised a brow at his sister. “Why do you say so?” He asked. \n“You were smiling alone, then suddenly laugh after. Are you normal or are you not?”—\nTae have thought about it, and laughed to himself thinking that he probably looked a like a fool smiling as he thought of Jungkook. \n“You’re doing it again! Our father in heaven holy be your name your kingdom come—“ \n“I’m not possessed, what the hell?!” He cried.—\nJennie went towards him as soon as she saw the letter ‘J’ on the handkerchief. \n“Aww! Is this for me?” Jennie tried to grab the cloth but Tae snatched it away. \n“No! You wish.” Jennie glared at him. \n“But there’s a letter J! My name starts with J!”—\n“I don’t care! This is for me!” Jennie crossed her arms. “Your name is Jaehyung now huh?” \nAfter a few cat fights, she left. \n“That brat, is she the only person who’s name starts with J?” He whispered to himself. \n“I HEARD THAT!”\n"},{"title":"66","data":"[ TIME SKIP : THAT AFTERNOON ]\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/05c6b82df6fe81d239c2e0e40beb35947438b6c5/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f41516d68313147722d4d554a70673d3d2d38372e313639346266663765653436626235623830343734363332323739312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"[ TIME SKIP : THAT AFTERNOON ]\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/e0a0035b59dc9346a39aea4e69111a29734a8fe1/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f63745571475076596534636f31513d3d2d38372e313639346266663837666633626137623832393531313136393930312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"308\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n<br>308.\n“Mom please? I just wanna do another design please?” \nIts been a minute of convincing his mother onto accompanying him on the market to buy another color of thread and cloth to try another design for his gift for Captain. \n“Tae, your hands are sore! Take a rest.”—\n“Nooooo I’m totally fine! I’ll be more careful, I swear!” He pleaded with all his heart. \nHis hand was now wrapped in a cloth to stop it from bleeding further, and to cure it too.\nAfter a few moments of convincing her, “Fine! But in one condition,” she said.—\nTae felt scared at the condition, but he’ll do anything she says at this moment. “You’ll tell me about you and Jungkook. Deal?” \nTae blushed at her condition, and he couldn’t help to smile. “Okay, fine!” \nAs soon as that, they rushed to the market.—\nThey searched through the corners of the wide place along with the sea of people. \nThey bought a few already, but Tae was really eager to but the most beautiful color. \n“Mom, how about this?” He showed her a pretty thread with the touch of crimson.WARNING ‼️\n— mention of blood<br>— death<br>— gunshot \nPlease skip the next few thread if you’re sensitive in this topics ‼️—\nHis mother nodded, “Okay, I’ll let you pick some colors first.” She said as she stepped back behind him to give space on picking. \nBut her vision was too clear to let that guy covered in black clothes slide off. \nHe was pointing a fucking gun from the distance — to Taehyung.—\nEverything went in slow motion for her as soon as she saw the guy pulled the trigger. \nWith one snap, a loud gunshot got the people panic. Tae was surprised too, he flinched. \nBut felt his heart sank instead as soon as he saw his mother fell on the ground with blood.—\nTae couldn’t speak, he was so much in shock. He was shaking so bad as he catch his mother from falling onto the ground. \nShe was shot right into the heart. \nPeople were shouting and screaming to try and call the police or the doctors for help.—\n“M-mom...” Tae’s voice cracked as his knees went weak onto the ground. Valerie’s head was lying down on Tae’s lap, and her tears were falling down. \n“DOCTORS PLEASE!” The blood kept coming out from the shot. Tae’s eyes were blurry because of tears.—\nBut he still managed to rip off a piece from the elbow of her mother’s cloth. \nHe used to cover the shot, thinking that it can help stop the blood from flowing. \n“Mom the doctors are coming okay? Don’t worry, you’re gonna be fine.”—\nTears were flowing nonstop from his eyes.\n“WHERE THE FUCK IS THE DOCTOR?!” Tae screamed in despair. No one was coming, and he hated it. \nHe carried her mom in his arms to try and go to the hospital. \n“S-Son...p-put me d-down...”—\nBut he didn’t listen, he just continued walking and did not care about the people looking at them. \n“Honey...p-put me do-down p-please...” \nHe feel so weak, yet so angry about what was happening. \n“No mom, we’re getting you to the hospital to get cured—“—\n“I won’t m-make it...I c-can feel it already...” \nHis crying got even more intense and he finally knelt down on the ground as he placed his mother’s head onto his lap. \n“You can’t just say that!” \n“Shh...stop crying...it would hurt m-more...”—\nBut instead of stopping from crying, he cried harder. His thoughts were such a mess that he couldn’t even think well. \nHis mother reached out her arms and cupped Tae’s face. \n“I-I....I know you’re not my son...t-that you’re from the f-future...”—\nTae was surprised, but he couldn’t utter a word since his cries were just getting louder. His heart felt too heavy to speak. \n“And I know that y-you have a special mission f-for our country...” her breathes are getting shorter. \n“I will tell the gods to take care of you...”—\n“And even if y-you’re not my son...I’m still happy that I got my time to spend it w-with you..”\nTae grabbed her hands and felt its warmth, he just hated it so much since he knew he’ll never get to feel it anymore.—\n“Please take care of your siblings, especially Jennie...m-make sure she finishes her s-studies okay? Tell them I love them b-both...” \nTae couldn’t even hear her words clearly anymore because he was sobbing too hard. \n“My son...if ever you meet him..tell him I love him too.”—\n“Mom stop talking, save your energy, you’re not gonna die yet!” Tae cried and he felt hope as soon as he saw a doctor running towards them from the distance. \nHis mom flashed her impish smile, “I love you...” \nTae shook his head and sobbed onto her hands.—\n“I love you too mom...please don’t leave me again...” \nTae witnessed how her mom died from giving birth in the future, and now, he witnessed it again, but this time — it was because of him. \nHe hated himself for that...so much.—\nIf he only knew this will happen then he should’ve not asked her to go out, he could’ve just stayed in the house with her. \nIts was his fault. \nHow can he not protect his own mother? \nAnd now, the woman he loved the most, died in front of him.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/40d29a65820d5ab85393c47a4f1885d9120f5879/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f474e324c755653574c4931682d513d3d2d38372e313639346330323133383830363038623934363930373635393131392e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\"And now, the woman he loved the most, died in front of him\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/2a53372abd6300b593e2d3fa270ea47479243838/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f53464248454d76307153334153513d3d2d38372e313639346330323161323131356133383433373132343931343937362e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"494\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/a4e8660587f2af83a3ce626d2e245e17571ed351/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f527475745562336b797078755f773d3d2d38372e313639346330323231653535333864653937373639383732353439302e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/2624821da179075101e76c96cb7c2dfb18a06a83/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f49597458343161546b48583261513d3d2d38372e31363934633032326132356635363036343339353037343631392e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n"},{"title":"67","data":"310. \nA hard slap met Taehyung’s face that he got thrown into the floor, and his elbow got bruised. \nBut that’s not what he’s crying about — but he’s crying that he knew he deserved that slapped. \n“THIS IS AL YOUR FAULT!” His father cried.—\nJennie was crying in the corner, and Yoongi was in tears too, but he’s trying his best to stop his step father from hitting Tae more. \nCuz he didn’t want Tae to experience what he suffered. \n“BECAUSE OF YOU YOUR MOTHER DIED! YOU KILLED HER!”—\n“Sir stop, please—“ Jaewon pushed Yoongi so hard that he fell on the floor. \n“HOW DARE YOU FUCKING TOUCH ME?!” He was shaking in anger, that the light in his eyes disappeared. \n“I hate you so so much! Fuck you!” They were so surprised when Jennie cursed.—\nShe was referring to their father. “You’re a monster! You’re the one who—“ \nJaewon immediately held her cheeks and squeezed it in anger. “Look at this little princess being so brave.” \nTae immediately stood up and and hit Jaewon’s hand away from Jennie.—\n“You are all the same,” Jaewon gritted. \n“From now on, I have no children. I shall not see any of you in my household tomorrow or you’ll be after your mother.” He pulled the trigger and it almost hit Yoongi’s arm. \n“GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE!”<br>309. \nTae did not expect walking at this cold night with all his things. Its winter, and its almost Christmas. \nHe still haven’t moved on what happened awhile ago, it was still very fresh to him — especially the pain. \nAnd he’s glad that he finally leave that house.—\nBut he was fine if its only just him, he can take care of himself. But it got more harder knowing that he also burdened his siblings. \n“I know a place to stay.” Yoongi spoke, its been so quiet.\nThey just let him lead the way, since he’s the only one who knew.—\nIt was a few minutes of walking, until they finally arrived into a place Tae was somehow familiar. But he couldn’t remember why. \n“Where are we?” He asked, voice still weak. Yoongi knocked on the door, and it opened as soon as that. \nTo Tae’s shock, it was Bogum.—\n“Taehyung?” Bogum spoke, surprised at the sudden presence. “You knew each other?” Yoongi asked. \nTae didn’t have the energy to answer so he just nodded. “Come in!” Bogum said since it was very cold outside. \nThey hesitated at first, but Yoongi assured them.—\nBogum’s mother appeared, and maybe she already heard what happened. \nSince their father is a General, he’s quite famous in the town. And since lots of people know them, the news about their mother’s death immediately spread. \n“Please feel at home.”—\nThey quietly sat in the couch. No one was speaking in one of them, but you couldn’t blame them. \nBut of course, an an elder, Yoongi has the responsibility. “Can I talk to you privately?” \nHe asked Bogum, and he agreed.—\nWhile Yoongi was outside with Bogum, Heena sat beside Taehyung. \n“Hey, I know its hard. But you guys can stat with us as long as you want.” She comforted, and even tho Tae didn’t feel like it, he still smiled. \n“Thank you ma’am.”—\nHeena shook her head and smiled. “You can call me mother too. And she’s your sister right?” \nShe was referring to Jennie who was staring in the blank space with her swollen eyes. \n“Yes, she is.” Heena stood up. “Hold on a sec, I’ll cook you guys dinner.”—\nAnd with that, they we’re left alone in the living room, embracing theirselves to give warmth. \nTae can feel it, he knew Jennie was sullen. And even tho they often bicker jokingly, they’re still siblings. \n“Jennie,” Tae called in a gentle voice. “Are you mad at me?”—\nJennie wiped the tear from her cheeks then looked down to her fingers. \n“I’m not gonna lie, I am.” She spoke, and Tae understood. He, himself, was also mad of him. \n“But I’m more mad because of myself.” It caught Tae’s attention. \n“What do you mean?”—\nShe was hesitating, but as soon as she thought of it, she bursted in tears again. \n“That bastard was the one who sent the guy.” She said in between her cries. \nTae couldn’t speak, he even almost stopped breathing.—\n“I heard him talking to someone in his office and he ordered him to kill you. I was gonna tell you but you guys left already. So I ran after the both of you, but I was too late.” \nJennie couldn’t stop sobbing. Tae immediately pulled her for a hug.—\n“W-What if I came early? What if I wasn’t late? If only that motherfucker didn’t send someone to shoot you then mother wouldn’t have died....” \nTae felt so guilty. What if he did not convince his mother at all? \nShe would have been alive still.—\nBut the tears falling from his eyes aren’t just because of sadness, but of anger too. \nJaewon must’ve been so crazy right now knowing that he sent that killer to kill Tae but instead, his wife died. \nIt was his fault. It was all the fucker’s fault.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/8c3a48a625edccb3dd39dad58d50d3e22074ec8a/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f7337625a6b623249504a316f4c773d3d2d313130353138333531312e313639346561373135343162353039373237303736373737323132332e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\" It was all the fucker’s fault\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/8a909eb5a61c67e39e80388102dd182be89ecda1/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f667838535277636a4470685767673d3d2d313130353138333531312e313639346561373162353335346135623433333936303732323038312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/01f81a48ed1ab6e09f7adbee683ab76d75bcbecf/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f557a7555646277392d4f785762413d3d2d313130353138333531312e313639346561373234383832623436633530353630393139313431342e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/37946cbfdca445f8a4d6bdc4191afd1ef3fec1d0/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f30515252696850316337566b79773d3d2d313130353138333531312e313639346561373264633832393532363336333334383132303538342e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"311\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n<br>311. \n“You guys can stay here. No worries, my aunt owns this house but she’s living in another city so no one else goes here but me &amp; my family.” \nBogum said as they enter another house beside them. It wasn’t small, nor big. Just enough for them to fit in.—\nBogum helped them fix their things and told them about the things in the house. \nAfter everything was settled, Jennie had fallen asleep, and Yoongi had just went to bed. \n“Aren’t you going to sleep?” Bogum asked, Tae was just standing still.—\nTae shook his head slowly. “I don’t think I can sleep.” He said, but he really looks tired. \nBogum couldn’t say anything, and just sighed. He wanted to cheer up Tae just for a short time. \n“I’ll just get something, stay here.” Bogum said and went outside.—\nTae went outside the house to avoid disturbing his siblings and to also wait for Bogum. \nNot long after, Bogum arrived with a bouquet on his hands. Tae thought it was flowers, but he somehow smiled when he saw that it was a bouquet of strawberries. \n“Jajaaaan!” Bogum said.—\nHe handed Tae the bouquet. Well luckily, he did not throw it away yet. \n“You said you strawberry is your comfort fruit right? So I thought, maybe you’ll somehow feel better if you eat this.” \nTae chuckled, he felt so touched at how thoughtful Bogum was.—\n“Did you make this?” Tae asked, they went onto their mini garden and sat on the bench together. \nIt was already 11 in eve, but Tae felt like the sun above the middle of the night — he’s questioning his existence. \n“Yeah, I made it. Do you like it?” Bogum asked.—\nTae nodded with an impish smile. “Yes, its looks beautiful.” \nBogum bit his lip to control his smile. He wanted to jump like a 5 year old kid out of happiness. He’s really glad that Tae liked it.\nBut since Tae was gloomy, he couldn’t.—\nTae ate the strawberries in silence. His eyes were tearing up, but he felt so drained to even shed a tear. \n“Do you...wanna talk about it?” Bogum asked gently, he didn’t want to trigger him.\nTae let out a shaky and heavy breath. “I don’t know either...”—\n“So many things happened today and I wasn’t even ready...” Tae started. \n“But right now, all I can think of is my sister. I promised mother that I’ll make sure she graduates and have a good life. Her school was in Australia, but how am I gonna send her back there?”—\n“Can’t she just study here in Korea?” Tae shook his head, “She had a brighter future there. Our father can not control her and she’s much safer in Australia.” \nBogum did not speak, he didn’t want to. He’s not used to this kinds of scenarios but he’s a good listener.\n"},{"title":"68","data":"—\nBogum’s eyes lingered onto Tae’s right hand, it was covered in cloth and it has stains of blood. \n“What happened to your hand?” Bogum asked. “O-Oh uh...” \n“I injured myself...I was doing the gift for Captain.” He said and took out the handkerchief in his pocket.—\nBogum nodded, he didn’t know how to react. \nCaptain must be lucky to have someone like Taehyung. And he wanted to feel that love too. \nHe wanted to feel how much Tae cared for Captain, he wanted to feel how its like to be loved by Taehyung.—\nBut sadly, he was in reality. \nHe can never be feel that love. He can never feel those lips of Tae on him. He can never hear Tae tell him the words ‘I love you’. \nFor short, he’ll never be Jungkook. \n“Can I see?” Bogum asked.—\nTae handed him the handkerchief, and Bogum smiled as he take a look at it. \n“It looks cute.” He commented, oh how he wished it was for him. “Really? How do you say?” \n“Maybe its because you made it.” Tae blushed a bit on his words. \n“I’m sure Captain will like it.”—\nTae smiled as Bogum handed him back the hanky. “Thank you.” \nHe was surprised when Bogum held his injured hand, and he was very gentle to make sure that Tae won’t be hurt. \n“You told me I have you right? I just wanted to let you know that you have me too.”—\nTae smiled and held Bogum’s hand back. \nHe have no words, he felt to drained to speak further. So he just laid his hand against Bogum’s shoulder, and closed his eyes. \nAt least, the moon understood him.—\nAs soon as Bogum felt that Tae was asleep, he slowly leaned towards to give him a gentle kiss on his head. \nHe felt brave, since Tae was asleep. But he also felt sad, since he knew that he can never do anything further. \n“I love you...how I wish you do too...”\n\n                                <img

At this time, Tae should be getting ready to go back to the camp for training. \nBut up to now, he was still sitting on the bed, staring at the blank space. \nYoongi was not on his bed, and he’s worried why.—\nJennie was still sleeping, and gladly she is. She’s too young to experience losing a parent, and Tae felt so bad for it. \nThree small knocks were heard from the door, it opened. “Hey, are you going?” Bogum asked. \nHe’s already in his trainee uniform.—\nTae nodded his head, “I’ll be a bit late.” He said and Bogum grew worried. \n“I’m praying you won’t get caught by our trainer.” He chuckled then left. \nTae decided to stand up and went to the kitchen to atleast prepare some breakfast for them.—\nHe’s not a great cook, but he can decently cook. \nNot long after, he heard the door opened, and Yoongi was panting for breath. \n“Hyung?” He went to see Yoongi who’s covered in sweat. \n“Where have you been? Are you okay?” Tae asked.—\nJennie was woken up by the noise, “What’s going on?” She asked with her morning voice. \nYoongi held up his hand to breathe. He sat on the chair and drank water to replenish his thirst. \n“I went to the nearest port here, I heard you and Bogum’s conversation last night.”—\nTae was intrigued, he then sat beside him. “The next ship later at 10PM is towards Australia. We can catch up before school starts again.” \nYoongi said, Tae wanted to go, but there’s one problem. “Hyung...we don’t have money...” \nYoongi took out something from his pocket.—\nIt was money — its a lot — maybe enough to buy them a house, but paying the ship fee is enough for it too. \nTae was surprised at the sudden amount of money. “Where did you get this?” He asked. \n“I saved it from my income, I know I can use this one day.”\n\n                                <img

Her heart felt so heavy. \nThey’re now in the port, there are a lot of people. And for their safety, they wore some scarfs to cover their faces. \n“She’s right, just come with us Tae.”— \nBut as much as Tae wanted to go with them, he can’t. \n“You’ll be much safer there! That bastard can’t hurt you—“ \nHe hushed his sister, and Jennie started crying. “I wanted to but I can’t. I have my reasons and I can’t tell you. But please, please take care of yourselves.”—\nJennie hugged him and cried in his arms. Yoongi came for the hug too, because what if this is the last time? \n“Change your names if needed, so that Jaewon can’t trace the both of you anymore.” Tae said. \nJennie pulled away from the hug, looking at one direction.—\nTae looked at the direction that she’s looking at, and his heart broke as soon as he saw Jimin. \nIt hurts him, because what if the future will change? What if it’ll affect Jennie and Jimin’s story and Jimin — Tae’s best friend won’t be born anymore? \nThat just hurts.—\n“Go.” Tae told her, and Jennie was confused. “Huh?” \nTae gave her an assuring smile. “I know I told you that ‘no-boys-until-graduation’. But I’m not gonna stop you now. Tell him everything you want before the ship arrives.” \nJennie can never be so touched.—\nShe immediately ran to Jimin and they hugged each other. \n“She’s really a grown up now.” Yoongi commented, he felt like a parent since he witnessed how his sister grew up from being a little baby — and now a lady. \n“Hyung...I’m sorry. It’s my fault...”—\nYoongi shook his head. “I want you to promise me that you won’t blame yourself anymore, even after we leave.” \nYoongi extended his arm and pulled out his pinky. Tae giggled, he thought its childish, but its pure. \nHe stuck up his pinky and clung it with Yoongi. “Promise.”—\nNot long after, the ship to Australia arrived, and people are starting to hop in. It was really tall, and huge. \n“We’ll see each other again right?” Jennie asked, wanting for an assurance.\nIts just a simple question, but he doesn’t know how to answer it.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/f35180d1c9b632b1ad716d730f7cf9246cc62322/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f5842625878435147356f574734773d3d2d39302e313639353439623638323636616161653735333739353238343738332e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\"Its just a simple question, but he doesn’t know how to answer it\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/a2526bb304f3fbbaf6368594afeaeb0b7ad527c9/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f4643366c4d5670506d77526d78773d3d2d39302e313639353439623665346139666261363530333830313632303330312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n"},{"title":"70","data":"319. \nEven if he’s not sure, he just nodded and smiled to make the two feel better. \nThey finally hopped on the ship and Jennie looked over the edge as soon as the ship starting moving away. \n“YOU PROMISED! WELL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN OKAY?” Jennie screamed.—\nTae sighed as he watched the ship sail away. He felt so sad when he couldn’t see it from his sight anymore. All he’s thinking&nbsp; is his siblings safety. \nHe saw Jimin behind him, and he really looks like Jimin from the future — but younger. \n“Hey,” Tae called.—\nThe younger boy flinched, Tae went towards him. \n“Do you love my sister?” He asked, it was so sudden that Jimin was frozen.

\n<br>322. \nTae almost slipped on the wall but good thing that his grip was strong. \nWell as you can see, he chose to climb the wall than to peacefully enter the gate since he’s afraid of the punishment again. \nAkyat bahay gang to tall.— \nHe’s now crouching above the walls, and hems about to jump down the camp when he realized that it was too high. \nHe mentally cursed himself for being such a scaredy cat. But fuck, he hates heights so much. \nLuckily, he saw Bogum walking on the hallway below him.—\n“Psst!” Tae called, Bogum stopped walking and tried to listen to his surroundings. \n“Pssst!” Tae called again, but this time, Bogum took out his holy rosary. \n“Holy Mary full of grace, the lord is with you,” Tae mentally face palmed. He thought he’s dumb.—\n“Hey! The hell are you doing?” Tae was almost whisper-shouting so that no one else can hear him. \nBogum looked up, and his face of relief is funny. “Oh my, I thought a ghost was calling me.” He said. \n“Do I look like a ghost? Come help me here!”—\nBogum went to his direction and opened his arms like he’s gonna catch him. \n“What’s that?” Tae asked, “An arm? Its edible. Want some?” Tae rolled his eyes and laughed. \n“You told me you trust me, now jump. I’ll catch you.” Bogum said.—\nTae did not hesitate to jump down the wall, he almost squealed but luckily Bogum catched him in his arms. \n“Thanks.” Tae pulled away when he realized that they we’re too close. \nYou thought they’re gonna stumble together? No &lt;3 I have something better for that 😌—\n“Mr. Kim!” They both heard a voice from afar. And Tae felt so nervous when he saw who it is. \nIts their trainer. Well, he’s probably dead. \nTae immediately saluted then bowed to him. “Goodmorningsirimsorryimlateipromiseididnotditched—“ \n“Hey no, its okay.”—\nTae was so surprised when their trainer said that. “Bogum told me everything this morning. You’re excused for today. I share my condolences with you.” \nHe said then left. \nTae felt so relieved because of that. “So you climbed a wall because you didn’t wanna get punished?”—\nBogum laughed hard, and Tae thought its annoying. He rolled his eyes and smacked him on the arm. \n“Ouch! You little munchkin!” Bogum almost cursed, he caressed the part that Tae hit. \n“Deserved.” He ran away, but went back to say a thing. \n“Thank you!” Then ran away again.—\nBogum giggled to himself, he’s feeling butterflies in his stomach and he can’t control it. \nIt was too overwhelming, that he thought its too much. He was scared, and even more scared now that he knew he’s falling harder.\n“Cute...” he whispered then went back to his business.<br>[ TIME SKIP : AFTERNOON ]\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/f01938cc0cb0186fbb29fd36b044bbcc7bd08ff1/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f484834433766776e7449655172773d3d2d39312e313639356632383933373336303036663839353530333130393731372e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\"[ TIME SKIP : AFTERNOON ]\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/c916e96e85a60f17e8c03cf402f69cbeed822dfe/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f516d576f417867676b484f7857413d3d2d39312e31363935663238393839633937363834393139393334313434352e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/ab135d9732a8ac1770eccd90a46cf7719e315646/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f474c4f62546b43774443547677513d3d2d39312e313639356632386131646236653263373234363238323337313335372e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"(Am so sorry if i did not post for a while because am too busy but here you go hope you like it) \">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n(Am so sorry if i did not post for a while because am too busy but here you go hope you like it) \n"},{"title":"71","data":"325. \n“Where is Taehyung?” Seokjin asked as they gather in the field. All of the soldiers are here to wait for 12AM. \nIts Christmas. \nThey were having a feast of food which were placed on a long wooden table. \n“I think he’s in the room. I’ll fetch him.” Bogum said.—\nBut before he leaves the table, he snatched a piece of chicken, afraid that it might get consumed before he can even taste it. \nHe finished the leg of fried chicken even before he arrived in their room. He washed his hands and opened the door. \n“Taehyung?” He called.—\nHe saw him peacefully sleeping on his bed in the corner. Bogum giggled, he thought it was cute. \nBecause Tae probably forgot about Christmas thats why he slept earlier. But Bogum knew that there was another reason why. \nHe slowly went to him, afraid to wake him up.—\nHe sat on the edge of the bed, and tucked Tae’s hair behind ear since it’s blocking his face. \nThe lights we’re off, but the shine of the moon hit Tae’s face perfectly.\nBogum couldn’t help but to smile. “How are you so beautiful even in your sleep?” He said.—\nHe saw that Taehyung was holding onto the hanky that he made for Jungkook. \nBogum’s heart ached. \n“I know you slept early because you’re planning to welcome Captain by the port.” \nJungkook was very lucky to have Tae. Can Bogum have Taehyung in another life?—\n“I just hope he won’t hurt you. I will always be here for you, even if you need me or not.” \nHe slowly leaned forward then placed a gentle kiss on his forehead. \nYes, he’s a coward. But that’s the only thing he can do. He can never go farther than this.<br>326.

Tae was confused, “Merry what?” He asked.\n“I said Christmas. Hello? Earth to Taehyung?” Namjoon joked. \nAnd finally, Tae realized it.—\n“It’s Christmas today?” He asked, dumbfounded. “Yes! How do you not know?” \n“Well he went to sleep early yesterday. You did not even join us in the dinner.” Their teammate giggled. \nBogum came inside the room. “Oh! Good morning!” He greeted.—\nTae was startled when Bogum damped the icing of the cake onto his face with his finger. \n“Hey! How dare you!” Tae cried and Bogum laughed a bit. \n“I was just testing if you’re awake already. Like seriously, you didn’t know it was Christmas already?”—\nTae wiped the small icing out of his face. He shook his head, “I really don’t know. By the way Merry Christmas!”\nTae grabbed the small pile of leaves on the window and threw it like a confetti. “Hey! You’re littering!” \nTheir teammate laughed and Tae did too.—\n“See y’all later, I need to go somewhere.” Tae said as he wore the sweet smile on his face. \nSince its a holiday, they’re allowed to go out. No one knew where Tae is going except of Bogum. \n“Hey, the arrival time of Captain wasn’t announced yet.” He whispered.—\nTae wore his cardigan and scarf. “Its okay, I’ll wait for him.” He patted Bogum’s shoulder as a goodbye. \n“Tae it’s literally snowing outside!” Bogum cried, and Tae shouted from the distance. \n“Its okay! I’m okay!” \nBogum sighed, he’s really amazing.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/eb0cafb4a2c40d9f2a0c8485488d20fceb51148f/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f6e4268415a62537a4e4a36714f673d3d2d39322e313639363635653965393863646530353833383139343632383439352e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"Bogum sighed, he’s really amazing\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/cf222f3420470f913ef10f9d1ead2f42dc06d9ce/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f614d71504635396450615f6a72673d3d2d39322e313639363635656137613662616430313431373635333633313830302e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"600\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/e439c498eb96c2aa301f233d525842c7cb9a3631/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f596952624b35685a7077635f42673d3d2d39322e313639363635656231393262656437613836393433333737323931362e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/4d9eec64c9dcf16b1baec0e47482926b52a39b9e/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f6953793253657a66736e55314d513d3d2d39322e313639363635656261343232313463613739343937373436393534322e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"329\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n329. \nTae arrived at the port at 9 in the morning. The sun was shining fair, but the heat of it wasn’t enough to keep him warmer. \nHis cardigan and scarf were really helpful, but he just wished that his cardigan was thicker since it really cold outside.—\nIts already 12 in the noon and the ship from America isn’t arriving yet. There are people, but not lots since there are a few ships arriving because of the weather. \n“I’m hungry.” Tae growled, luckily, he spotted a nearby eatery. He decided to eat lunch for a moment.—\n1 in the afternoon, Tae was really eager to wait. \nTo distract himself, he decided to think of a cheer that he’ll do as soon as Jungkook arrives. \n“5,6...5,6,7,8...!” \nHe started rehearsing his small cheer for Jungkook and people are giving him the looks.—\nMaybe thinking that Tae is possessed. He even saw an old woman took out the holy rosary from her pocket and did the sign of the cross. \nIs he really this weird for 1894? \nHe laughed to himself, maybe he’s being too happy. But he couldn’t help it.—\nJust imagining that Jungkook will arrive today makes him so happy. \n3PM, lots of people are still here. And a few ships are arriving. But still, the ship from America hasn’t arrived. \nHe took out the hanky that he made for Jungkook.—\nHe smiled as he looked at it. He’s never been like this. He’s never exerted so much effort just for someone. Not even for his family before. \nHe changed, a lot. He realized a lot of things that he haven’t back then. And Jungkook taught him that.—\nThe wounds on his hands we’re still there, and he’s not regretting those. \nHe kissed the pendant of the necklace that Jungkook gave him. He’s still wearing it, and its the most valuable thing for him besides Jungkook. \n“I’m waiting for you, please arrive safe.”— \n7PM, Tae was losing his energy, but not his patience. He’s willing to wait no matter what. \nSome people are still here since there are still ships arriving. He was sitting down the bench since his legs we’re growing tired. \nHe even almost fell asleep.—\n9PM, Tae’s ears rose as soon as he heard the staff of the port say, “Next is the ship from America. Please don’t crowd the way for the people.” \nTae’s heart felt excited that he can already jump in happiness. \nHe went near the edge of the port where people are also waiting.—\nHe can already see the ship from the distance it makes him nervous due to excitement. \nHe held tight onto the handkerchief and he can feel his hands shaking. \nHe bit his lip to hold back his smile because he smiled too much today. “Omygod, how to calm down?”— \nThe huge ship arrived at its designated place and as soon as it was settled, the people started going down the ship. \nTae was very observant of the people coming down so he won’t miss Jungkook. \nA lot of people is still coming down and Tae isn’t losing hope.—\nBut he felt so disappointed when the last person that came out of the ship wasn’t Jungkook, not even Lisa. \nDid he miss it? Did he not see him coming down? \nTae felt anxious, his emotions literally dropped down.—\n“Maybe there’s gonna be another ship from America. Don’t lose hope Tae! They said he’ll arrive today.” He comforted himself. \nHe sat back on the bench, but his energy wasn’t the same anymore. \nNot long after, its starting to get colder to the point that Tae was shaking.\n—\n“Cold...to cold...” he said as he embraced himself to give warmth. \n“Jungkook baby...where are you? I hope you’re not cold...” he whispered to himself. \n11PM, Tae fell asleep on the bench. There are almost no people around since its almost morning.—\nLittle did Tae know, Bogum went after him and hid behind the walls to still keep an eye on Taehyung. \nHe wanted to make sure he’s safe. And now, he thinks its time to get him home. \n“Tae...” he gently patted is arm to wake him up. “Hmmm...?” Tae hummed.—\n“Let’s go home...its late.” Bogum said. \nHe saw that Taehyung was shaking because of the cold. Even his breath was visible in the air. \nBogum immediately took off his cardigan and switched it with Tae’s since its much thicker and it can save him from the cold.—\n“Nooo stop...I’ll wait for Jungkook...” Tae murmured in his sleep as he felt that Bogum lifted him on his back. \n“He won’t arrive. The office was also surprised that he didn’t attend the welcoming conference. None of them knew what happened.”\n"},{"title":"72","data":"—\nAs soon as that, he felt the collar of the cardigan was wet. And Tae was silently crying. \nHe sighed, he felt hurt knowing that Tae was hurting again. \n‘If you only chose me, then u would never cry.’ Bogum thought. But was so wrong to think that Tae will ever love him back.—\n“I miss him...” Tae murmured, he did not know that his words were piercing Bogum’s heart. \nBut Bogum can’t do anything but to comfort him. \nThey arrived at Bogum’s house, in which Tae was temporarily living in too, there are people, and they’re drinking, and having fun.—\nWell, its Christmas. Its their tradition. \n“I want to eat.” Tae cried as soon as Bogum put him down. The amount of delicious food on the table was making him hungry. \n“You didn’t have dinner yet, didn’t you?” Bogum asked, and Tae nodded.—\n“Okay, lets eat for now.” They went to the celebration and people started greeting them since they’re just their neighbors. \nBogum avoided long conversations with them since he wanted to give Taehyung some comfort. \nHe’s eating quietly, but he looks so hungry.—\nTo the point that he already had three rounds of eating. \nBogum was just having fun watching him. He think its cute that everytime Tae stuffs food in his mouth, his cheeks are puffing out. \nBogum grabbed a beer, but only for him. He can’t let Tae drink.—\nBut he gave a juice for Taehyung, a strawberry juice to be exact. He knew its his comfort food. \n“I love strawberries, its not even funny.” Tae muttered as he drank his cup of juice. \nBogum chuckled, Tae looks cute for him today. “Are cheering up yourself?”—\nAs soon as that, Tae burst in tears. He was sobbing like kid that people are looking at them already. \n“Hey, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to!” Bogum was panicking but he tried to sound gentle so he won’t scare Tae. \n“Why d-didn’t he c-come?” Tae said in between his cries.—\n“H-he said just 1 week r-right? He said he’ll come back, he p-promised me!” Tae’s sobs were getting louder. \n“Hey, hey, calm down okay? Its gonna be fine.” Bogum comforted him. \nTae grabbed the cup to drink his juice. But he was surprised at the taste.—\nHe made a face out of the taste, “B-Bitter? This isn’t m-my juice...” Tae said. \nAnd with that, Bogum knew he fucked up. Because Tae grabbed his cup of beer instead of his juice its the cups have the same color. \n“Shit, its my beer.”—\nTae can feel his throat burning, even his upper body. Its really hot, its his first time drinking beer. \n“I-I want more.” He said as he tried to reach for the bottle of beer. But Bogum grabbed the beer away even before he touches it. \n“No! You can’t drink!” He said.—\n“Drink your juice instead, it can help take the burning feeling away.” He gave him his juice but Tae was too stubborn for that. \n“No! I want to drink alcohol, if you stop me i’ll cut your dick.” Bogum was taken aback by his words. \nHe didn’t know if he’ll laugh or be scared.—\nBogum cursed himseld for being so careless, he should’ve not drank beer while Tae was here. \nAnd now, Tae has drank another cup of beer. “This shit is really amazing.” He said. \nHe poured another glass, until another, until Bogum had enough.—\n“You had four glasses already, it’s enough. Look at you, you’re dizzy.” Tae’s face was flushed red, and he really looked dizzy. \nOr maybe he’s drunk already. \n“I can see the knife. I swear I’ll cut your elephant.” \n“Tae I’ll cut your elephant too fuck you.”.<br>—\nTae laughed, and Bogum didn’t know whats funny. \n“Do you know spongebob?” Tae asked out of nowhere. \nBogum raised a brow at the very unfamiliar name. “Sponge what?” He asked. \nTae gasped, and pointed a finger at him. “YOU DON’T SPONGEBOB?! HOW DARE YOU?!”—\nBogum was startled. He has no idea about what the fuck is a spongebob. \n“FOR YOUR INFORMATION—“ Bogum stuffed a strawberry into Tae’s mouth to stop him from speaking. \nHe carried him in his arms to get him to sleep. Captain is gonna kill him.—\nWell, you see, Captain can never feel relieved without leaving someone to look after Tae. \nAnd even though he knew that Bogum liked Tae, he used those feelings to make sure that Bogum will protect him no matter what. \nAnd he trusts him, and Bogum didn’t want to break it.—\n“You disrespectful minion!” Tae cried as soon as he chewed the strawberry. \n“And you’re so bad for not knowing spongebob! He’s the first love of my life.” Tae smiled to himself. \nBogum felt weird. Whats so special with that spongebob?— \nTae was now in his bed, and Bogum was preparing some hot meal for him to lessen the alcohol in his body. \n“I miss the internet...my instagram is probably flop now. Omygod, I’m not famous anymore.” \nTae cried to himself. And Bogum felt even weird at the words.—\n“What is an ins..insta..instagram?” He asked but Tae just laughed. \n“Its a damn app idiot. Do you know Billie Eilish? I heard she’s nominated in the Grammys! Omygod she deserves those trophies so much!” \nBogum went loading for a second, until he’ve had enough.—\n“Taehyung...I don’t understand your language.” He said. \nBut maybe, his doubts and instincts were right. \nHe sat on the bed beside him, and looked at him straight in the eye. \n“Tell me the truth, are you from the future?”\n(ill try my best go published many parts today) \n"},{"title":"73","data":"330. \n\"Yes! It's a secret but since you're my *hic!* friend, I can tell you!\" Tae said as he did a hiccup, he looked so drunk right now.\nBogum was completely shocked at what he just heard. Because drunk people don't lie right? It was just too unbelievable for him.-\n\"W-wait...are you serious? A-are you really from the future?\" Bogum asked once again, he needed to confirm his guts.\nTae raised a thumbs-up then laughed. \"Yes! But I-I like it *hic!* more here b-because I'm *hic!* happy here.\" \nBogum was frozen.— \nHe’s right. All this time, he was right.\nThe first day he saw Taehyung, he looks like he’s not familiar of the camp even though he should since his father is a General. He also noticed how different Tae speaks to everyone, his words are informal but respectful.—\nAnd his things, the objects that he just saw from him we’re too advanced for this era. He can never believe that it came from here.\nBut how?\n“Where...in what year...or century did you came from?” He asked as he watch Tae chase the ants with his fingers on the wall.—\n“Y-year 2020...20th century.” Tae said as he pushed the ant away. Bogum gulped, is he really seeing a person who came from the future?\n“Why are you here? What’s your intention?”\n“Captain...I’ll *hic!* save Captain...” Tae said even though he’s only here to know his story.—\nBogum felt a bit scared at his words. “Save? Why would you save Captain?”\nTae played with his fingers like new born baby who saw its fingers for the first time. “For h-history.” Tae answered.\nBogum’s brows furrowed, his head was hurting.—\n“Is there something bad? What’s gonna happen to Captain? What do you mean about for—“\nTae groaned and Bogum immediately stopped talking. Tae shut his eyes tight in annoyance. “Agh! You ask too much *hic!* Slow d—“ \nAs Tae opened his eyes, he was so surprised.—\nLooking up straight to Bogum who’s sitting on the edge of the bed while Tae was lying, he was looking down at him. \nTears fell from Tae’s eyes as he couldn’t get his stare away from Bogum. “H-hey, are you okay?” Bogum asked.\nTae’s hand flung onto his mouth due to shock.—\n“Whats going on? Are you hurt—“ Bogum was surprised as soon as Tae cupped his cheeks. Tears were continuously falling down his eyes as he keep his surprised expression.\n“Jungkook...” Tae muttered, Bogum was so confused as to why Tae randomly called him Jungkook.—\n“Huh—“ \nTae’s sobs got louder. He started touching Bogum’s face like it was his first time seeing him again. “Y-You’re here...” Tae cried.\n“I knew you would come today...” Tae smiled in tears then quickly pulled Bogum towards him for a kiss.\nTheir lips meet.—\nTae was lost in the kiss, but Bogum was so surprised to the point that he can’t even move. \nBut the longer he feel Tae’s lips on his, with the taste of alcohol — it fucking drives him crazy — he’s addicted.\nIsn’t this what he wanted? Isn’t this what he’s been dreaming of?—\nWell, yes. But as the same time — no.\nHe never dreamt of kissing Tae while he’s in his vulnerable state. He never dreamt of kissing Tae knowing he’s somebody else’s property. \nAnd u know what hurts more? This isn’t Tae that he’s kissing — cuz it was just the alcohol talking.— \nHe immediately pulled away but Tae was pulling him back for more. “Tae stop! I’m not Captain—its me Bogum! Ur just drunk thats why you’re seeing things!”\nHe cried as he held Tae’s wrist to stop him. \nTae stopped, but he started crying, and this time — his sobs were painful.—\n“Stop Tae...I’m not Captain...” Bogum said, but more gentle. Because he was hurting too, knowing that he can never be Jungkook.\nBut on the side of his perspective, he saw a blurry figure standing distantly on the side.\nHe turned around to see clearly.<br>—\nCold expression, hand on the hook of the door — he looked different — but it still him.\nBogum immediately stood up and bowed down with his trembling soul. “Captain...” he said.\nTae was unfortunately asleep, and he did not even see Jungkook.—\nJungkook did not utter a word, but he signaled him to follow him outside. Bogum immediately stood up and went outside of follow him.\nAs soon as they stopped right into their garden, Bogum knelt down and lowered his head against the ground as a sign of apology.—\n“Captain I sincerely apologize for what happened earlier. I know you saw it and I swear to the heavens that, thats not my intention, I respect you and—“\n“Stand up.” Bogum got chills at how cold and deep Jungkook’s voice.\nHe stood up, not being able to look at him in the eye.—\nJungkook handed him a letter, and Bogum opened it. “Pardon sir, but what is this for?” He asked.\n“I came here order you to lead the tomorrow’s welcoming for the American soldiers. They’ll arrive tomorrow and I want everything to be in place. Are we clear?”\n“Sir, yes sir!”—\nBogum saluted and Jungkook nodded as an acknowledgement. He dared to leave, but Bogum didn’t want to waste the opportunity.\n“Captain,” he called, &amp; Jungkook paused in his tracks.\n“Tae is inside. Why not go see him? He’s really longing for you. He even waited for you, sir.”—\nJungkook looked back, still keeping the same face from earlier. “he prepared something for you and he really worked hard for it. I’m sorry if he’s drunk, but he’ll be so happy if he sees you.”\nJungkook raised a brow. “Why do I need to see him?” He paused.\n“Are we together?”—\nBogum was so surprised at his words. Did he hear that right? \n“He’s a trainee. What’s so special about him for a Captain like me to waste seconds just to see him?” Jungkook asked. Bogum couldn’t read his expression.\nJungkook shrugged, and turned around to leave.—\nBut before he could go farther, Bogum shouted.\n“Without all due respect sir, but is Taehyung just a toy for you?” Bogum was shaking in anger, but he wanted to control himself.\nJungkook just paused in his tracks, but he did not answer. A few seconds later, he finally left.—\nBogum shut his eyes tight as he clench his fists in anger. He was so furious, he didn’t know what happened but he wanted to punch the hell out of Jungkook’s face.\n“How dare he treat Tae like that?” Bogum whispered to himself. \nHe went back inside the room to see Taehyung.—\nAnd his heart ached as he saw him sleeping so peacefully on the bed like nothing happened. \nAnd you know what hurts more? He’s holding the pendant of the necklace that Jungkook gave him, and the hanky that he made for him on the other of his hand.\nBogum sighed.—\n“I wanted you to know that Captain is here, but I the same time, I don’t.” Bogum spoke, looking at Tae.\n“Because from how he acted earlier? I know you’re just gonna be hurt.” He sat on the couch &amp; closed his eyes to sleep.\nBut he’s wondering...\n“What happened to Captain?”\n\n      <img

\n<br>333. \nTae groaned as soon as he unmounted the callesa. His head felt like it was beating and it hurts so bad. \n“Urgh, I shouldn’t have drunk.” Tae said as he held onto Bogum for support. \n“You should’ve stopped me!” Tae cried as he massaged his temples.—\n“I wonder who told me he’ll cut my dick if I ever try to stop him.” Bogum said and laughed when he received a smack on the arm from Tae. \n“You know I’m stubborn. You should’ve knocked me off.” Tae cried. \nIts Friday, he still wanted to sleep but Bogum woke him early.—\nMaybe its just around 3 in the morn? They usually go to the camp at 4 but Bogum told him that they need to do something important. \nWell, he’s still not mentioning that Jungkook has arrived already. \nBogum is still hesitating, he didn’t want Tae to be hurt again.—\nHe’s still wondering, what time did Jungkook came? Tae was in the port all the time but how they did not meet? \nJungkook really seemed new for him. \nThey finally entered the camp together and Tae quickly flopped himself on the bed as soon as they get in their room.—\n“Tae are you okay?” Namjoon asked, watching as Tae curled himself into a ball. \n“He’s having hangovers.” Bogum commented, “Hey, you need to stand up. We need to prepare for the opening.” \nTae groaned like he’s a 5 year old throwing a tantrum.—\nTae got up, but a frown on his face was made. \nWell actually, he was just distracting himself from thinking about Jungkook’s whereabouts. \nOnly the heaven’s know how worried he it right now, his heart was longing for him so much. \nOnly if he knew.—\nJust minutes after, they gathered in the field and as Jungkook ordered, Bogum instructed his fellows about what to do. \nThey went to the plaza and this time — they we’re armed — the did not want anything bad to happen again.—\nThere are so many people in the plaza, but as they saw the soldiers arrive, some of them immediately went away. \nMaybe, they’re traumatized &amp; learned their lesson.\nThere are decorations on the plaza stage, but it was pretty simple. Now, they’re just waiting for the guests.—\nAfter a few hours of waiting, couple of callesas came rolling on the ground. \nThey we’re all unfamiliar faces, since Tae never knew anyone from America. They really look different, and you can easily tell that they’re from another country.—\nTae respects them, but he’s still doubting since he knew how history was told. \nThey saluted at the visitors, chest out, straight body, eyes on one direction, and no talking. Its really suffocating, but this is their job. \nThey have to be disciplined.—\n“Face...to the right!” Bogum instructed, he was in the front. \nAll of them faced the right, where there was a huge empty gap for the guests to walk in between, while there’s another sea of soldiers at the other side. \nThe soldiers from America walked in.—\nThey are really tall, and their features are amazing. Their fire guns are carefully ducked in the belt where there’s a small pocket for it. \nThey look cool, for this era, they are really known for having good equipments. \nBut despite of all the distractions,—\nTae can never take his eyes away from this person leading in front of the visitors.\nThat person was the one who thought him love, who made his heart fly in euphoria, who made his whole world change, and the one who he fell inlove with. \nThat person — was Jungkook.<br>—\nTae was stiff in his place, his world stopped in a moment, he couldn’t even lift a finger! \nHe can only hear his heart beating through his ears, it was so loud, he felt like it would come out. \nHe was shaking literally, he’s confused, but he felt so happy.—\n“Taehyung, what are you doing? Salute to them!” Seokjin lowkey whispered to him as soon as he noticed that Tae wasn’t saluting. Its quite disrespectful. \nLuckily, even before getting caught, Tae successfully lifted his hand and saluted to them.—\nHe wanted to scream and make the people around them disappear so that he can finally run into his arms. \nHe missed him so much, and now, he’s here. \nHe doesn’t care about not seeing him in the port, he was feeling euphoric that he couldn’t even think well.—\nBut Jungkook — Tae felt like he’s new. \nHis once cheerful eyes looked sharp. He’s not even smiling, and his expression was very hard to read. \nMaybe, maybe its just because there are visitors. Maybe because he’s at work. \nTae thought. Well, he thought.<br>.\n"},{"title":"74","data":"[ TIME SKIP BECAUSE IM EXCITED ]—\nAs soon as they arrived back into the camp, Tae couldn’t stand in one place knowing that Jungkook is just around. \nHis heart was jumping, he was really too happy, and he thought just for this time, its fine. \nHe was outside the hallway, walking back and fourth.—\nBiting onto his fingers, he was feeling really anxious besides of being happy. \n“Should I go or should I not?” He asked himself. He was contemplating if he should go to Jungkook’s office or just wait for the day to finish so they can have more time.—\nTae thought of seeing Jungkook in the office, and just by that, he’s suddenly smiling to himself. \nThen he laughed knowing he looked weird. Oh fuck, love hit him hard, did it? \nBefore his eyes, from the very distance, a familiar figure was seen.—\nThe person was standing still, aligned to his direction. \nTae felt like jumping because he can already feel butterflies in his stomach. \n“He’s there, he’s standing there oh fuck I think I’m gonna pee.” He cried as he felt nervous.—\nBut he said fuck it. \nHe ran towards the direction, its not his time to feel shy now, he’s waiting for this since last week. \nAnd he’s not gonna waste this time. \nAs soon as he was right close to him, he pulled Jungkook into a tight hug.—\nFinally, for this time, he finally get to touch him. “I-I missed you.” Tae said as he felt like crying. \nHis voice cracked, but he didn’t want to cry today. He’ll reserve it for later. \nHe cupped Jungkook’s face and pulled him for a kiss — a kiss that he’s been missing.—\nButterflies started crowding his stomach, he felt like flying as soon as their lips meet. \nOh how he damn missed this sensation. \nBut he stopped when he realized that Jungkook wasn’t kissing back. His heart broke, but maybe Jungkook was just tired.—\nHe pulled away awkwardly, he felt so embarrassed and he hated that feeling. But he still pulled a smile onto his face. \nHe fidgeted with his fingers, “I-I’m sorry, you’re probably still tired.” Tae let out an small laugh. \nHe felt even nervous when Jungkook was just staring.—\nTae gulped, he didn’t know why he felt intimidated of the person he used to be so comfortable with. \n“I’m glad you’re finally back. I’ve been waiting for you—I waited for you at the port! Hehe, how come I did not see you there?” \nHe tried to hype the mood.—\nBut still, no answer. \n“I’m still wearing the necklace you gave me—and oh! Hold on, I made something for you!” He cried. \nHe pulled out the hanky he sewed for him out of his pocket. It was nicely folded, and Tae was really careful of it like it was a treasure.—\nHe presented the hanky to him. “Jajaaan! I made a hanky for you. It may not be the best but I made that on my own! Look! I sewed the initial of your name here!” He pointed on the corner of the cloth. \nJungkook’s eyes went to Tae’s bandaged hand, then to the hanky.—\nTae flashed his smile as he wanted to lighten the atmosphere, even though he’s feeling anxious. \nJungkook accepted the hanky and looked at his from his own hands. “You made this? As a gift for me?” He asked. \nTae bit his lip to control his smile. “Yes! Did you like it?”—\nJungkook let out an impish smile as he look at the cloth. \n“I do. I like it.” He said, and no one can be more happier than Taehyung knowing that Jungkook liked his handmade gift. \nEfforts paid off I guess? Well no.—\nBecause he can never be more surprised when Jungkook crumpled the cloth into a ball then threw it into the trash bag from their side on the distance. \n“But I think the trash likes it more.” Those we’re Jungkook’s last words before he left without even sparing Tae a glance.<br>—\nTae couldn’t move, his eyes were locked in one single direction.\nHe felt so hurt, too much pain was ruling over him to the point that he can’t feel anything anymore. \nIt hurts so much, it was too much for his heart. \nHe did not even realize that he’s crying again.—\nHe thought he’s finally going to be happy when he sees Jungkook. He thought that maybe this love would be forever. \nBut forever, was the biggest scam the universe can offer.\nJungkook seemed different.\nBecause the Jungkook he knew, would never do that to him.—\n“I finally found you! Look, I got this small strawberry from the park, it looks cute I think you’ll like it—“ \nEven before Bogum could finish his words, he was cut of when Taehyung hugged him. \nTae was crying so hard onto his chest, and his knees were falling down.—\nBut Bogum made sure that he has his hands around Taehyung to make him feel safe an comforted. \nHe gently caressed the back of his head as Tae let out more of his cries. He was shaking so bad. \n“Just let it out, I’m here, I won’t leave you.”—\nBogum closed his eyes and gritted his teeth. He knew who caused him this. \nHe already saw that this will happen, because even if he didn’t tell Tae that Jungkook was here, they’ll still meet. \nThat’s as much as he can, he’s trying to keep Tae company to comfort him.—\nBogum looked onto the side of the hallway, where he can see Jungkook from the distance talking to another soldier, maybe it was Captain Hugo. \nTheir eyes met, he thought Jungkook would be affected by seeing him hugging Tae. \nBut he just looked away and left.<br>[ TIME SKIP BECAUSE IM EXCITED ]—\nSince its Saturday the next day, Bogum decided to go home and take Tae with him since he that he’ll just feel frustrated knowing that Jungkook is around. \nIt was around 10 in the eve, Bogum was sleeping in the other house with Tae but different beds to keep him comfort.—\nTae stood up from the bed, wore his cardigan since its cold outside. He opened the door and dared to leave, but Bogum woke up when he heard it. \n“Where are you going?” He asked, sitting up from the bed. “Just gonna visit my mom.” Tae said.\n“Okay, I’ll go with you—“—\n“No, its okay. I’ll be fine—“ , “Tae its late, I’ll go with you—“\n“I appreciate you but I just wanted to be alone for now...please.” Tae gulped as he felt a lump on his throat. He’s tearing up again. \nBogum sighed, maybe he was going too far. “Fine. Take care okay?”—\nWith that Tae left the house. \nIt was warmer than yesterday, he can fight the cold. It was really dark in the road since the only lights were old lamps. \nHe walked and walked, and walked until he finally felt what he’s waiting for.—\nThat feeling of someone following him, that feeling of being in danger, he’s been looking for that. \nA person from behind pulled him and covered his mouth even before he could scream. “Mrfhrhfj!” Tae cried. \nHe was being pulled into a dark alley.—\nAs to how he thought, even before he can get pulled into the alley, someone hit the person from behind that made him loose grip on Tae’s. \nThe person kicked the culprit and even right before he could take out his knife, Jungkook twisted his head to lock the oxygen in him.—\nThe culprit fell on the ground unconscious. \nTae’s knees were weak as he was feeling so scared. He fell down the ground on his knees, but even if he’s crying, he still get to smile. \n“I knew you would come and save me.” Tae cried.—\nTae planned this, he knew someone was following him again so baited himself to summon Jungkook since he always shows up everytime Tae is in trouble. \nAnd he’s right. He did that so he can talk to him. \n“I won’t let him kill you.” Jungkook said.—\nTae didn’t know what to feel, he knew Jungkook will always have a reason in his actions. \n“I knew you still cared—“ but he was surprised when Jungkook pointed the gun down at him. \n“J-Jungkook, please put the gun down...I’m s-scared.”—\nEyes wide open, Tae’s heart can never be more broken by his words. \n“I won’t let him kill you because I should be the one doing that.” \nWith those words, a loud gunshot was heard, and Taehyung fell on the ground.<br>334. \nEverything felt heavy for Taehyung as soon as he woke up from a familiar place. \nHe was lying on the rough ground, surprised that his hands were chained, and the steel bars we’re right before his eyes. \nHe slowly rose up from the group, eyes adjusting to the light.—\nThe lights were torches, and old lamps, as you could expect from the 1890s. \nHe’s in jail. \nHe can tell it because he’s been here. But this time, he was even scared since he didn’t know why he’s here again. \nThoughts rushed to his mind as son as he saw Jungkook standing ——\nbehind the bars. He quickly stood up and went towards him, only to hold onto the steel bars thats keeping them apart. \n“Jungkook...what’s happening?” Tae’s voice shaked, he remembers what happened earlier. \nBut he trusts Jungkook so much, would you call him fool now?—\nHe immediately stepped backwards as soon as two civil guards started unlocking the gate of the bars. \nThey went inside the cell, so as Jungkook. \nNo one knew, how much Tae was hurting. All he’s ever imagined was happiness when Jungkook comes back. \nNot this.—\nHe’s never been like this. Its his first time for a serious love and he ended up being hurt. \nBut could you blame Tae if he still loves him? \nJungkook was the first and only person who taught him what love really is. And he’d be happy to say that he’ll be the last.—\nThe other guard was holding a whip. He swung it in the air to hit Taehyung from the distance, but the guard was more than surprised when he instead hit Jungkook. \n“How dare you move without my orders?” Jungkook scoffed. The blood was visible from the sleeve of his arm.—\nHe was bleeding, and the guard did not even expect that Jungkook will block the hit? \n“I’m sorry sir, my apologies.” The guard bowed as an apology. Jungkook glared at him and clicked his tongue when he felt the sting of the hit. \nBut he needed to endure it.—\nTae was kneeling down the ground because of his shock on the whip. He thought it would hit him, but it didn’t. \nJungkook slowly walked to his direction, he knelt down to his height, and looked down — avoiding eye contacts.\n“So...” Jungkook started.—\n“Which punishment would you like to receive?” Jungkook asked, leaving Tae in confusion. \nEven though nothing had started yet, he’s already tearing up. He’s too hurt for this. \n“P-Punishment? What did I d—“ \nJungkook let out a bitter laugh. Tae felt so scared.—\n“Nice acting, I’ve had enough of it.” Tae looked into Jungkook’s eyes and even though he wasn’t looking back, he was so worried when he couldn’t see the sparkle in Jungkook’s eyes anymore. \nHe’s been blinded by anger, was he? \nJungkook stood up.—\nHe signaled the two guards for something, and within just a split second, another two guards came in pulling a barrel filled with water. \nAs soon as it was in, the guards pulled Tae over and their grips were hurting his arm. \n“W-What is this?” Tae asked in a shaky voice.—\nJungkook raised a brow. “How can you not remember the thing that you used before killing my brother?” \nTae cannot speak, he couldn’t even think. He was so confused at his words. But slowly, he realized it. \nJungkook went out the cell &amp; locked it. “You’ll stop in my signal.”—\nAs soon as Jungkook left, Tae was surprised when the guards pushed his head down the barrel. He couldn’t breathe because of the water. \nHe thought he was gonna die but luckily, the guards pulled his head back up. \nHe was just gasping for breathe when his head was down again.—\nAnd it went again, and again, until Tae was almost fainting because of tiredness and hurt. \nThe guards threw him down the ground as soon as they received Jungkook’s signal. \nTae coughed as he felt the water into his throat. His hair and the half of his clothes were wet.—\nAnd I hope I’m kidding, but its winter — its fucking chilly even in indoors. \nTae couldn’t stand the cold, he can never fight it. He has low tolerance in cold, and now, was even worse. \nThe guards left and locked the gate of the cell.\n"},{"title":"75","data":"—\nTae fell down the ground again. He has no energy left, he was so drained physically and emotionally. \nWhat was happening? He hated that he didn’t even have any clue. \nHe took a look at his hand that was bandaged, the wounds were still there. And it hurts more.—\nBecause he felt like his efforts were also thrown away as soon as Jungkook trashed his gift. \nHe worked for that, so hard. He didn’t even stop even if his fingers were hurting. It may not be the best, but he exerted all his love &amp; effort there. \n&amp; Jungkook did not see that.—\nTae felt his tears falling down, but he doesn’t have the energy to sob anymore. \n“Jungkook...you promised my you’ll protect me.” Tae whispered to himself, his voice was too weak. \n“You promised me, didn’t you?” His voice cracked as he felt a wave of tears coming again.—\nHe just cried in silence, because he knew that no one will come and comfort him. Just himself. \nA few minutes of shedding tears, he was surprised when a female voice spoke inside the cell. \n“Does it hurt?” Tae flinched, he immediately rose from the ground.—\nTae’s eyes bawled, “M-Miss Fairy?” He cried, he didn’t know if he should be happy or worried that he’s seeing her. \nThe goddamn person or mystical creature that sucked him into the past, damn. \n“Y-You’re back! I can’t believe I’m seeing y-you.” Tae said.—\nThe fairy was painting her nails, and the objects were too familiar to him. “Where did you get the nail polish? \nThe fairy smiled as she was satisfied with her nail color. “I went to the future, the other Tae gifted me this. Isn’t it lovely?” \nShe showed him her fingers.—\n“Y-yes—“ , “Oh of fucking course not.” \nHe flinched at the sudden thunder of voice. He looked at the fairy and her aura changed now. \n“I am very angry right now Kim Taehyung.” She stated, making the polish disappear within just her touch.—\n“W-What did I do...?” Tae finally asked, he looked down his hands, the grip of the chains were hurting his wrists. \nThe fairy stood up, then walked back and fourth like she’s thinking. \n“Which one, the bad news...or the other bad news?”—\nTae couldn’t choose. Can he never get out of sadness? Its all bad news today. \n“Either, i’ll leave it to you.” Tae said with his weak voice. “\n“So basically, the original Taehyung from here was the mastermind of the death of Captain’s brother.”—\n“He did it out of jealousy since the girl he likes was inlove with Junghyun. He asked a killer to kidnap him, make him suffer, and then kill him. Cruel right?” \nTae felt surprised at the information. He never knew that the old Tae was this worse.<br>—\n“But out of the blue, he realized his wrong doings since was only brainwashed by his father. He tried to stop the killer from killing Junghyun but it was too late since at the time he arrived at the place, Junghyun was already dead.”—\n“He spent 3 years coping with his guilt. It was made worse when he realized that Junghyun has a younger brother. He was scared that Jungkook would come for revenge so out of pressure and guilt, with all of his emotions, he wished to go to another world to forget everything.”—\n“And at that same time, you also wished to live in his world to so you won’t have to suffer in researching.” \nTae couldn’t blame himself anymore from being so dumb. Because he’s somehow grateful that he met Jungkook here. \n“Now for the other news,”—\n“That was the damn reason why I fucking told you not to be so close with Captain. Because I know that you’ll be in danger. But I have no right to tell you about that.” \nThe fairy breathed in like she was calming herself. She was shinning in glitters and light.—\n“You—you—argh! You! You don’t know how much I’m wanting for this day to come so I can finally scold you!” \nTae flinched at her voice, she was pointing so harshly at him. \n“If you only listened to me, then the future wouldn’t have changed!”—\nTae was so surprised at her words. “C-change...the f-future?” Tae asked. \n“Yes!” The fairy massaged her temples due to frustration. “I couldn’t go back to the future anymore after you and Jungkook kissed! Oh my god!” \nTae went silent. \nHe changed the future?—\n“Now, I don’t know what’s going to happen to Jungkook anymore. I don’t even know if he’ll still be known as a hero or if he’ll die! You changed the history—the past! And now, even the future changed! Gosh, this is stressing me you little munchkin.”—\nIf he really changed the future, then what will happen now?\nHe was scared knowing that Jungkook will die eventually, but he’s even scared because he didn’t know what’s gonna happen next anymore. \nWould that be a good thing? Or nah?—\nAnd how about the future? Would his life still be the same even if he comes back? \n“I’m sorry...” that was the only word that Tae spoke. He was so drained, so tired, so hurt. \nThe fairy sighed, and looked down at him. She somehow felt pity, but she cannot show that.—\n“I want you to choose,” she started. \n“Would you want to go back to the future? So that you can no longer ruin the past? Or would you stay here, and find out what happens?” \nThought empty, he couldn’t even think. But that tough question, was forcing him to.<br>—\nWould he still want to stay here? After all that happened? And even if he felt like Jungkook isn’t the guy that he loved anymore? \nOr would he want to go back to the future? To save his own family? To take care of the country? \nIt was hurting his head. Can he not decide?<br>335. \nTae bit his lip, thoughts we’re scattered on his head. \nHe was feeling so anxious to choose, since he didn’t want to mess up again. Or what if he does? \n“Honey, I’m waiting.” The fairy looked at her fingernails in boredom, then looked back at Tae with a worried face.—\nHe couldn’t decide well, he’s feeling too pressured. \nBut all he can think of, was Jungkook. \nHe closed his eyes tight, then spoke his words, “I choose to stay.” He was shaking in nervousness, did he make the right choice? \nThe fairy sighed.—\n“Good,” she started. “Even though I know that you didn’t do what you’re being accused, you still deserve the punishment that Captain is giving you.” \nTae thought, maybe she was right. \n“I told you in the first place to just stick in your mission. But you didn’t listen.”—\n“You made a big change. I’ll let you stay here, but I have a condition.” \nTae felt scared about the condition, but he chose this right? \n“Even if the history change, I want you to make sure the same ending — Captain will be known as Korea’s savior.”—\nTae couldn’t utter a word, does she mean that Jungkook would still have to die in the end to be known? \nBut she didn’t say anything specific right?\n“That’s your last mission. And please, please stick with it. If you ever fuck up again, I’m not forgiving you anymore.—\nThe fairy held her hand above Tae’s head, and a shower of glittery lights appeared, then gone. \n“W-What did you do?” Tae asked, he felt like it was an enchantment. \n“I still have mercy, so I decided to lessen your suffers. Remember the mission. Till again, Kim Taehyung.”—\nWith those words, the fairy disappeared within the speed of light.\nAnd Tae was left alone again. He felt like he’s gonna faint again because of how heavy his heart is. \n“Can the heart of a person change? Can the heart forget the promise it made?” Tae asked himself.—\nHe crawled and lean against the wall for support. He can feel his body being weak again, and his tears were trying to peek out. \n“If our love for each other...is the one who’s stopping you from getting the justice you wanted...” \nTae paused as he tried to hold back a sob.—\nWith a heavy heart, his voice cracked as he let out a silent cry. \n“Then I do believe that the heart of a person can change. And the heart can forget the promise it made.” \nHe curled himself into a ball, and cried his pain out. \nBecause what else can he do than that?\n"},{"title":"76","data":"[ FLASHBACK ]—\n“Jungkook!” \nA voice cried from behind the walls, not much far from where Jungkook was standing. \nHe lifted his head, and gave Lisa a piercing glare. “You’re not a damn criminal.” \nShe went towards him and snatched the gun from Jungkook.—\n“Revenge is different from justice Jeon—“ \n“It’s just the same — revenge is just more brutal.”\nJust awhile ago, Tae was kneeling down, begging him to drop the gun. But instead, Jungkook pulled the trigger that made Tae fall onto the ground.—\nHe did not shoot Tae, he just fainted out of fear. And Jungkook shot the bullet onto the side, not to Tae’s direction. \n“I’m not liking the way you’re talking.” Lisa said, she immediately called the callesa over. \nJungkook carried Tae on his arms.—\nHe hated the feeling. Coz you know what? He’s never thought of doing this. \nRight after he went to the US, all he can think of was to go back and hug Tae, give him kisses, and shower him all the love he had for him. \nBut it just hurts that they’ll meet again like this.<br>[ END OF FLASHBACK ]<br>336. \n“I checked on him, he’s asleep.” Lisa went inside Jungkook’s room. They’re both currently living in the same house because of pretending. \nJungkook did not even spare her a glance and just continued doing paperworks. \n“I don’t need that information.”—\nLisa sighed, she sat on the couch in front of Jungkook’s desk to talk to him. \n“You’re such a coward.” Lisa said, making Jungkook look up to her with an annoyed expression. \n“What is it again?” He asked, and dropped the quail.—\n“You’ve told me how much you wanted to make the person who killed your brother suffer. I’ve known you like my brother Jeon, and I also know that you can’t hurt him.” \nJungkook didn’t want to talk about it, he continued to do his business and ignored Lisa. \n“Shut it.”—\n“The most common punishments for prisoners is getting beat up right? But instead, you chose the thing with the water because you know that you can’t stand seeing him being hurt.” \nJungkook glared at her, “Stop it, get out.” He ordered. \n“Its true right?”—\n“I mean you could already kill him that night, even If I stop you, you won’t let me. But you shot it on the ground instead—“ \n“Shut the fuck or I’ll cut your tongue!” Jungkook stood up in rage, slamming the table hard. \nLisa knew she was right.—\n“You don’t have the right to shout at me like that—“ \n“And you don’t have the right to dictate me about my life either!” \nJungkook was shaking in anger. Lisa had seen him in this state, but she knew that he can be worse than this.—\nBut Lisa, she felt hurt, and offended. She knew that he’s gonna throw her some words but she didn’t expect this. \nNot from the person whom she treated like a family. \n“You do not fucking understand how hard it was for me when my brother died!”—\nJungkook clenched his fist, his eyes were tearing up. He hated to go back to time where he suffered the most. \n“You don’t know how much I was starving because I had no money for food. You don’t know how many houses I knocked onto just for shelter,”—\n“That motherfucker burned our house to make sure that nothing is left. I was fifteen that time and I don’t know how to survive! My brother was the only family I had left and they took him from me— you’ll never understand my pain because you are not me!”—\n“I was in the verge of dying that I had to force myself to eat the leftovers in the trash just to fucking survive!” \nJungkook was breathing so hard as how hard he was crying. \nHe felt quite light since he’s been stopping these emotions for years.—\n“And you...you’ll never get the pain I felt on that time that I saw the pictures and found out that Taehyung was the one who killed my brother. And you know what?” \nOut of pain, he didn’t even realize that his fist was bleeding because of too much clenching.—\n“I wanted to punch him, I wanted to shout at him and kill him for good!” \nHe was bawling in tears, he didn’t know that these emotions would be a lot painful now. \n“But when I saw him again? Smiling at me so sweetly? And even bruised his hand just to make me present?”<br>—\n“I don’t fucking know where my anger went. Because when I saw him, I just wanted to hug him, tell him everything and cry on his shoulders. You don’t know how much I longed for his presence. And its not fucking easy for me to send the person I love the most into suffering.”—\n“But I want to get the justice I promised for my brother. And now you’re here telling me everything that I was such a coward of?!” \nLisa flinched as soon as JK swung his arms onto the row of vases &amp; it fell on the ground. \nIt shattered, but their hearts were more broken.— \n“I know you’re hurt. But you don’t also have the right to point on me like that like you don’t know what I’ve gone through.” \nLisa harshly wiped her tears as soon as it fell. “My own father killed my fiancée, Jungkook. I was so mad at him that I almost tried to kill him.”—\n“But I found out that I was defending the wrong side. My fiancée was just using me for money, and my father just wanted to protect me.” \nIt was so hard for her to hold back her sobs since the scars from the past still hurts. \n“All this time, I hated him for no reason.”—\n“I cursed at him, disrespected him, I even heard him crying in his room because he was hurt. Do you know how much I hated myself for that?” \nNothing could ever be painful, than a child seeing its parents cry in silence.—\n“I know this isn’t about me. But I was just trying to help you. I was also surprised when I found out that Tae was the killer. You don’t know how much he loves you Jungkook, I don’t think he can do this to you.” \nJungkook threw himself.on the chair then cried his eyes out.—\n“I’ll go out. Get yourself some rest.” She said, then left. \nJungkook let out a shout — a painful shout that only him can understand. \n“Why does it have to be you Taehyung? Why do I have to find it out just now that I’m deeply inlove with you?”\n"},{"title":"77","data":"337. \n“Excuse me, have you seen this guy? He’s this tall, his hair is—no? Okay, thank you.” \nBogum bowed at the person whom he asked as a respect. \nHe sighed, he looked at the drawing he was holding — he drew a picture of Tae to use it to find him.—\nIt was really cold so but his nervousness is making him sweat. \nHe’s been looking for Taehyung and asking people around if they’ve seen him since this early morning. \nAfter Tae told him that he’ll visit his mother’s tomb, Bogum couldn’t feel relief and sleep anymore.—\nHe was anxious about what might happen knowing that Tae is now in more danger because of his father. \nHe didn’t get enough sleep because of waiting for Tae to come back, and now, he’s dead worried. \n“Shit, Taehyung, where are you?” He asked to himself.—\nBut even if he felt like crying in worrying, he still continued to ask people around about Taehyung. \nHe shows the picture, then describes him, but he can never be more sad every time they say that they haven’t seen him around. \nHe sat on the bench beside out of tiredness.—\n“I knew it, I should’ve followed you. Damn it.” He cursed himself out of frustration. \nHe should be in the market helping his mother and brother with their business, but he’s here feeling so down. \nHe felt his stomach groan. He realized that he haven’t eaten lunch yet.—\nHe was just about to stand up to atleast look for some eatery, he saw Jungkook from afar talking to those American soldiers with Captain Hugo. \nBogum didn’t know if he should tell Jungkook because he saw how he acted that night. \nBut even so, he still needs to know right?—\nAs soon as he saw that they’re done talking, he quickly went towards them and called Jungkook. \n“Captain!” He cried, and Jungkook immediately turned to him. Nothing new, just the same old cold expression he’s known for. \n“Its weekend, do I have a business with you?”—\nJungkook asked, raising a brow. Bogum immediately showed the drawing to Jungkook and it made him confused. \n“My apologies sir, but I lost Taehyung. He told me he’ll just visit his mother’s tomb last night but he hasn’t came back up to now.” \nHe explained.—\nJungkook felt quite caught off guard at the words. “Mother’s tomb?” \nBogum nodded. “Yes sir, his mother died just days ago.” \nThoughts ran to Jungkook’s mind. He hated that his heart felt soft just by thinking how sad Taehyung might be. \nBut he quickly erased it.—\n“I don’t need an apology. And I know where he is.” Jungkook said and was about to leave when Bogum spoke. \n“Y-You know where he is? Captain, can you lead me to him?” He asked, and Jungkook looked back, but his expressions were unreadable. \nBogum gulped.<br>—\n“I just want to see him sir, I was really worried.” Bogum pleaded, his heart felt like exploding knowing that he finally knew where Tae is. \nJungkook was silent for a moment, but eventually he signaled him to the callesa so they can go where Tae was.— \nAs soon as they got there, Bogum was so confused why they went into their local jail. “Sir, why are we here?” He asked. \n“Didn’t you want to see Taehyung?” Jungkook scoffed back, and Bogum finally realized it. \n“Why is he here?” Bogum was somehow mad.—\nJungkook did not answer, he just let Bogum follow him.\nAs soon as they got there, the air was kinda suffocating him because the jail was like a cave. \nThey stood in front of Tae’s cell, &amp; they saw him standing with chained hands, observing the walls behind him.—\n“Taehyung!” Bogum cried and held onto the bars. \nTae immediately looked back at the familiar voice, his eyes were swollen, and his face was puffy. \nHe’s been crying a lot. \nHe ran towards Bogum but there’s still bars in between them. He somehow felt happy seeing him.—\n“Bogum!” Tae felt like crying again but this time, its somehow mixed with joy. \n“Are you okay? Are you hurt? What happened? Why didn’t you come back? Why are your hands chained? You have a bruise, it would hurt!” \nBogum continuously said as he checked if Tae was okay.—\nBogum slid his hands in between the gaps of the bars to cup Tae’s cheeks and make him feel his warmth since he knew that Tae can’t stand the cold. \n“Are you crying?” Tae giggled as soon as he saw him tearing up. \n“Shut up! I was so worried of you, don’t you know that?!”—\nBogum took out the drawing from his pocket and showed to Tae with his tears falling down. \nHe looks like five year old crying because he finally found his parents in the mall. \n“I even drew you to ask people if they’ve seen you! My talent showed up because I was so worried!”—\nTaehyung felt touched at his efforts.\n“Thats me?” Tae asked, he tried to sound cheerful because he didn’t want Bogum to worry more. \n“Yes! If you say that it doesn’t look like you then I’ll cut your dick.” \nTae bursted in pure laughter when Bogum said that.—\nAnd Jungkook was just there, standing behind the walls where Tae couldn’t see him. \nAnd he didn’t want to see Tae either. Because even if he’s angry at him, he was still hurt that somebody else was making him laugh now. \nHe was so confused at himself.—\n“Why are you here? What happened?” Bogum asked as soon as Tae finished laughing. \nTae was hesitating. He didn’t know if he should tell Bogum or not, because that will include explaining that he’s from the future. \n“I...I did something wrong.” Tae said instead.<br>,—\nBogum knew something was wrong because Tae was not looking at him in the eye when he said that. \nJungkook decided to leave to give them privacy, and to also stop hurting himself. \nBogum sat on the ground, and Tae did too. The steel bars in between them were annoying.—\n“I don’t believe you.” Bogum said, the civil guards were far from them so they cannot hear their conversation. \n“I’m telling the truth. I killed someone.” Tae spoke, then fidgeted&nbsp; with his fingers because he’s anxious. \n“Tae you’re from the future, who would you kill?”—\nTae was so surprised at what he just said. He literally stopped processing. “W-What did you just say?”\nBogum sighed, “You were really drunk that night aren’t you?” \nTae didn’t know what he was talking about. “That night when we came back from the port,”—\n“You accidentally drunk my beer instead of your juice. You really had a low alcohol tolerance because you got drunk within 4 glasses.” \nTae knew he fucked up, but he didn’t expect it to be THIS FUCKED UP. \n“You told me that you’re from the future.”—\n“That’s all I did, right?” Tae asked, he was feeling so anxious because he couldn’t remember anything. \nBogum went silent, he was stopping himself from smiling. Because should he tell Tae about the kiss? \n“D-Did I do something else?” Tae asked, feeling nervous.—\nBogum shook his head, but he couldn’t control his smile. \nTae looked at him suspiciously, “I don’t trust you with that smile.” He said and it made Bogum laughed. \n“You’re changing the topic, now tell me the real reason why you’re here.”—\nTae gulped, even if he wanted to tell him everything, he didn’t know where to start. \n“Its a long story—“ \n“Its okay, I’m good at summarizing. I won an award about that during elementary.” \nTae giggled, but he got himself together. “Where do you want me to start first?”—\n“At the beginning of course! Do you want to start at the end?” Tae rolled his eyes then laughed at his words. \nBogum somehow felt happy that his efforts on cheering him up is working. \nHe told him everything, at the very beginning up to where they are now.—\n“Did you get it?” Tae asked as soon as he finished. \nBogum held up his hand as a sign of pause. “Wait. I need to process.” \nHe said and Tae just let him. It took him atleast a minute to finally speak. \n“You mean to say that Captain didn’t know it was another person?—\nTae nodded, his face turning sad again. “Taehyung, do you not fucking realize?” \nTae flinched at Bogum’s voice. It was still him, but there was another thunder in his voice that Tae never heard of. It was giving him chills. \n“You don’t fucking deserve this bullshit.”<br>—\nBogum stood up, his expression is scary. “B-Bogum, calm down. It’s s-scaring me—“ \nBogum sighed, he closed his eyes shut and breathed in and out like he’s calming himself. His fists we’re shaking for clenching too hard. \nHe’s mad as fuck.—\nHe knelt down to Tae’s height since he’s still sitting down. \n“Even if you did something that is a big deal, you still don’t deserve to receive the punishment of a crime that you’ve never done! Do you not understand that?!” \nTae flinched when Bogum shouted.—\nBogum realized that he was scaring Tae, so he decided to calm himself even tho he’s feeling so angry towards Jungkook. \n“I’m sorry, I got carried away. But Tae, I’m not letting you live with this. If this is okay for you then its not for me.”—\nBogum held Tae’s hand and pulled it out the bars. He kissed the back of his hand that is bandaged.\nTae was stunned at what he did, but he also felt butterflies in his stomach. \n“I’ll get you out of here, I promise.” Bogum stood up.— \nTae knew what he was thinking, and he’s nervous about it. \n“Bogum, what are you planning? Please tell me its not what I think...” Tae stood up and looked at him. \n“It is what you think. I won’t tell him everything, but if he really loves you, he has to understand.”—\n“Bogum...I told you about the hanky right? I don’t think he still cares for me.” Tae said sadly as he remembered the pain he felt that day. \nBogum shook. “He does Tae. I saw the hanky you gave, it was in his pocket. If he doesn’t care anymore, then why would he keep it?”—\nTae was surprised, his heart was aching so bad because of his overthinking. \nBogum finally left. \nHe sat back on the floor, still processing what Bogum just said. \n“He kept it?” He asked himself, he smiled to himself sadly. Atleast he knew he kept it.—\nBut even so, he was still worried of what might happen next. \nWhat if Jungkook would not believe Bogum? What if it’ll just make the situation worse? What if... \nWhat if he fails to do his mission again? \n“Jungkook, my love...I hope you believe me.”\n"},{"title":"78","data":"338. \n“How do I prove it to Captain? Think Bogum, think!” \nBogum told himself as he walked back and fourth inside the house were Tae was staying. \nIt been almost 8, and he already gathered all his sentences to tell Jungkook, but the only problem is...\nHe needed a proof.—\nHe’s sure that Jungkook would ask some proofs, and that’s what he’s trying to look for now. \n“What proof will it show? Ah this is hurting my head.” He massaged his temples due to frustration. \nHe breathed in and calm himself. “Its okay, this is for Taehyung, so I’m okay.”—\nIt was true tho. He may sound dumb, and fool since he’s exerting all his love and effort to someone that will never love him back. \nNo one know how much it hurts for him every time he comforts Tae about Jungkook. \nOnly the heavens will know the pain he’s going through.—\nBut its okay. \nEven if he’s hurting its okay. Even if Tae can never love him the way he does to him, its okay. \nHe’s okay. \nIts enough for him knowing that Tae acknowledges him, and that he can take care of him even if just as a friend. \n“I’m strong, I can do this.”—\nOut of nowhere, his eyes was pointed onto a certain bag that was quite new for his eyes. \nAn idea popped in his mind and he immediately smiled when he realized it. “Right! Taehyung’s bag!” \nHe immediately went towards it, but he hesitated.—\nIts not his thing to touch someone else’s belongings, and he felt awkward. \nBut this is the only way to help Tae. He gathered himself together and carefully opened Tae’s bag. \nAnd he’s right, the things in Tae’s bag were all from the future.—\nHe slowly took out some of the things inside it. Some were familiar to him, but some were too advanced. \n“Oh this! I remember this! This is a...cell...cellpie? cellpicture? Ah, This one is like a daguerreotype.” \nHe said as he take a look at the cellphone.—\nHe put in on the side to use it as one of the evidences. \nHe took out some more things, and this time, he was holding a ballpen. \nBut since the ballpen is the type where you need to click the above for the tip to show, Bogum felt quite threatened. \nHe thought it was a gun.—\n“This is scary, so no no no.” He was about to put in back in but he accidentally pressed the button thingy. \n“AH!” He cried, his eyes shut tight as he was expecting a loud bang, but only a smol click sound was heard. \nHe was so confused and looked at it.—\n“I thought it this is a gun? What in the world is this?” Bogum said as he inspected it. \nThe next was a charger, same expression from earlier, he was so confused at the things. \n“The future is so complicated.” He told himself.—\nHe was already finished taking out all the things that he thinks was too advanced for the past, but he thought. \nThere was one thing left, it was like a mic, but in a different structure. \n“What is this?” He asked and took it out. He saw there was a button on it.—\nHe clicked the button since he thought it would also be harmful like the ballpen earlier. \nBut he was so surprised when the mic thingy started vibrating that he threw it in shock. \nIt hasn’t stopped vibrating, Bogum stood up and stepped back in fear.—\n“Shit, I think its gonna explode.” He said as the vibrating hasn’t stopped yet. \nHe was quite a coward to hold it back and try to stop it so he just ran behind the behind and crouched to protect himself. \nHe covered his ears because he thought it was gonna explode.—\nBut minutes passed, nothing happened, nothing exploded. \nBogum slowly peeked from behind the bed to see if the thing had stopped vibrating.\nHe had never felt so relieved and safe when he saw that it stopped. He quickly got up and inspected it again.<br>WARNING ⚠️ \n— nsfw !!— tw // nsfw \n“Why did it vibrate like that? I wonder what’s the use of this.” He asked himself. \nHe has no idea that it was fucking vibrator. \nHe put everything he gathered as an evidence inside the bag and decided to finally get out.—\nHe went back to the camp, he knew that Captain would probably just be in his office because he always stays in there back then. \nHe arrived at the camp, and the soldiers guarding the gate was confused at the bag. \nI mean they’ve seen a bag, but not that advanced.—\nHe got in and knocked onto the door of Captain’s office. \nThe lights were on, meaning that Captain was there. “Come in,” he heard from the inside, and he immediately went in. \nHe saluted and bowed as a respect. “Sir, I need to talk to you about something.”—\nJungkook did not spare him a glance, he was busy typing on the typewriter. \nHe looks so stressed. \nAnd Bogum felt pity somehow, because he’s known Captain since he’s really known in the city. But that time when Tae came, his expressions were glowing and happy. \nBut now...—\nHe’s back to his intimidating and serious state again, and its even worse. \nHe can’t blame Jungkook for being angry. I mean, he has no idea that the Taehyung he loves and the Taehyung that killed his brother were different persons. \n“State it,” Jungkook ordered.—\n“I’m not going to make this any longer sir, I just wanted to say that you’ve been accusing Tae for something that he did not do.” \nIt caught Jungkook’s attention, his glared at him and raised his brow. “What do you mean?” \n“It may sound impossible but Tae isn’t from here.”—\n“He jumped back from the future sir, because of an unintentional wish, he exchanged souls with the real Taehyung from this era. Meaning that he’s stuck here and the real Tae was stuck in the future.” \nJungkook stared at him for some time, then turned around to get something.—\nHe turned back around and placed a penny back on the table like he’s giving it to Bogum. \nBogum was so confused, “Pardon, sir?” He asked. \n“What? Aren’t you telling me a joke? I thought you’re part-timing at the circus?” \nBogum clenched his fists in anger.—\nBut he still has respect for him, so he calmed himself down. \n“I’m not playing around sir, I’m telling the truth. The Taehyung that you’re punishing now is not the one who killed your brother, but the other Taehyung!” \nJungkook clicked his tongue. “Leave.”—\n“I’m not going to leave until you believe me, Captain.” Bogum emphasized the word ‘Captain’ since he’s slowly loosing respect for him. \n“Who do you think are?” , “And who do you think you are too?” \nBogum scoffed back, he couldn’t hold himself anymore.—\nJungkook stood up from his seat, the sparkles from his eyes are disappearing indicating that he’s gone mad. \nBut that wasn’t enough to scare Bogum, he’s here for Taehyung — not for himself. \n“You came all the way to distract me and tell me bullshit?”—\n“I have so much respect for you Jeon Jungkook, but if you keep giving Taehyung the punishment he did not deserve then I’m quitting it.” \nBogum threw the bag towards him. He didn’t really care if he’s being disrespectful now, he’s just really pissed off.—\n“What the fuck is this?” Jungkook asked, still not touching the bag since it was odd for him. \n“You don’t believe that Tae was from the future right? Then open the goddamn bag, sir.” \nJungkook was in the verge of punching Bogum, but he was too tired for a fight.—\nHe slowly opened the bag, and only one thing was familiar to him. \nHe immediately grabbed the phone because he knew that it belongs to Taehyung, he saw this from him before. \n“This is...a cellphone.” He muttered, he remembered what Taehyung said.\n"},{"title":"79","data":"A/n <br>(Am so sorry if am not posting some parts because am not feeling well this past few days i kept on really high fever and vomiting and etc ams so sorry at least now am kinda good so yeah am sorry back to the story)\n—\nHe knew that there was something odd when he saw this, but Tae told him he that he just got it from somewhere. \nHe didn’t know that the somewhere was the future. \nJungkook gulped, he didn’t want to believe it but its right in front of him now.—\nHe accidentally pressed the button of the phone in the middle and it immediately lit up. \nHe was so confused at first when he saw himself on the screen. \nIt was picture of him from the arcades, that night where Taehyung and him went out. \nHe was his wallpaper.—\nJungkook felt a pang in his heart even tho he doesn’t know why he’s seeing himself on the screen. \nHe gulped and sucked the inside of his mouth to stop himself from crying. \nHe saw the inside of the bag and its full of the things that is not familiar to him.—\n“I hope you believe me now sir. The Taehyung that deserves the punishment is not in here. Please free Taehyung, you don’t know how hurt he is—“ \n“Get the fuck out.” Jungkook said as he shoot the phone inside the bag and threw it to Bogum. \n“Sir—“ \n“GET THE FUCK OUT!”—\nJungkook was shaking in anger. \nBogum was silenced, because he was so surprised when he saw that Jungkook was tearing up. \nIt was the first time he saw a soldier cry. \nBogum bowed, he knew he did his job well. “Sir, yes sir!” He saluted then left.— \nAs soon as the door closed, he fell weak into his knees. \nHe let out the sobs he’s been holding back painfully in his heart. He doesn’t know what to feel anymore, he was so confused but he felt more like a fool. \nNow, someone has seen his weakness, and he hated it.—\nAll this time, he’s been forcing himself to be strong because he didn’t want to be taken advantage by other people. \nHe’s been hiding the pain for years, no one knew how much he’s gone through. \nAnd he can’t believe, that only love can make him this vulnerable again.—\n“Taehyung...” he called the name, he repeated and repeated calling it until only sobs were coming out from his mouth. \nHe did not know if he’ll believe Bogum, but by the reaction of his heart, he knew he did. \nBut wanted the truth to come out from Taehyung’s mouth instead.—\nHe took out the hanky that Tae him out of his pocket. \nThat day, when Tae left, he took the hanky back and washed it to make it clean. \nBecause that’s the only way that he can feel Tae’s love for him. And now, he needed his comfort the most. \n“Hyung, why?”—\nThis time, was calling out for his brother. “I thought getting the justice for you would be easy now that I’m in a high position...” he said. \nHe held the hanky onto his chest and let himself cry it out. \n“Why does it have to be someone that looked like Taehyung? Why?”—\nHe may look all tough from the outside like a very scary giant, but he actually just have a soft heart a child would have. \nIts just that, his experiences made him tough and aloof. \n“I need to talk to Taehyung.” He told himself, “Nothing will happen if I’ll just cry right?”<br>339. \nTae was woken up at the sound. The civil guards unlocked the the gate of his cell. \nHe felt scared since he thought that he was going to be punished again, and he’s almost tearing up just by thinking of that. \nIt was almost 12 in the morning and he was sleeping.—\nHe was surprised when one of the civil guards pulled his hand up and unchained it. \n“W-What’s happening?” He felt comfortable because his hands were now unchained. Those were hurting his wrists and it even made a mark. \n“Captain told us to free you. So you can now leave.”—\nTaehyung felt so confused, he did not know whether to feel happy or not. \nHe slowly got up from the ground and went out of the cell, from the distance, he saw Bogum patiently waiting for him. \nTae’s face lit up when he saw Bogum, he ran towards him for an embrace.—\n“W-wait—I can’t...—breathe...!” Bogum spoke in the hug, Tae immediately unlocked it to give him space. \n“I’m sorry, I was just happy to see you. I know you did something for me to get out. So really, thank you.” Tae showed a sincere smile.—\nHe was surprised when Bogum pulled him closer for another hug, and he laughed when Bogum jokingly cried on his shoulders. \n“You better thank me! I almost got in trouble because of you!” He cried, and Tae giggled. \n“No, for real, I’m really glad you’re out.”—\n“I’ll treat you lunch tomorrow as a pay back! Deal?” Tae offered, flashing his boxy smile. \nAs many would want to, Bogum felt like giving him a quick kiss on the forehead because he was acting too cute. \nBut he just felt pity for himself knowing that he sounded pathetic.—\nBogum just nodded and cleared his thoughts. “What did you do by the way? Did you talk to Captain?” Tae hesitantly asked. \n“Yeah, I talked to him. He shouted at me so I did too. We’re fair.” He winked and Tae doesn’t know if he’ll laugh. \n“You what?”—\n“What? I’m sorry okay but I was just pissed! I actually got somehow scared when I saw that he’s tearing up in anger.” \nTae went blank “T-tearing up?” Bogum nodded. \n“Yeah, after I showed him ur things as the proof, he told me to get out and I saw that he’s tearing up.”—\nTae was having mixed emotions. He’s only seen Jungkook cry once, but its really rare to see it twice since people say that he’s not really like that. \n“You made a big impact on Captain, Taehyung.” Bogum said.\n‘You made a big impact on me too.’ Bogum sadly thought.—\n“Wait, hold up. You told me you showed him my things as the evidence, right?” Tae felt nervous. \nBogum nodded, “Yes, I think he believed me tho.” \n“D-Did you see something...w-weird?”\nBogum shrugged. “All your things are weird. But that thing that vibrates is weirder.”—\nTae’s face flushed red as soon as he realized it. “Are you okay? What’s wrong?” Bogum asked as Tae looked away. \nEven if he tells him the reason, he might just embarrass himself and make Bogum uncomfy. \nCuz how is he gonna tell him that its something used for pleasure?”—\n“Whats that thing called by the way? That scared the crap out of me.” Bogum said as he reminisced about last night. \nTae laughed nervously, “Haha, you don’t need to know.” He said. \n“Anyway, I need to take you to somewhere. Do you trust me?” Bogum asked.—\nTae raised a brow then smiled. “You don’t have to ask me that. Of course I trust you.” \nBogum felt flattered at his words, “Even so, I still want to ask. I don’t want to make you uncomfortable.” \nThey went outside the local jail and rode the horse that Bogum brought.—\nBogum was the one leading the horse, and Tae was sitting in front of Bogum. \nHe smiled to himself as he remembered that Bogum was the one who took out the courage in him once again on riding a horse after the incident. \nAnd he’s very, very thankful for that.—\nIt was a not so long ride, Tae was quite confused when he realized that they were in the forest, and Bogum was taking the way towards a cliff. \nBut he trusts him, he knew he wouldn’t do anything that can harm him. \n“Why are we here?” Tae asked. “You’ll find out later.”\n(Ill post some parts today😊)\n"},{"title":"80","data":"A/n <br>(After i did the 79 part i got my left ear clogged and pain so right now in pain actually so i dont think after this i could post a lot parts i try one by one and yeah i hope you guys enjoy so far and yeah back to captain jeon and his lovely kim taehyung🤗)\n—\nAfter a minute, they finally arrived at the cliff, where there was someone who’s sitting on the edge of it. \nThis place was very familiar to Taehyung, since this is the place where Jungkook confessed to him. \n“Captain asked me to bring you here. You two need to talk.”—\nTaehyung hopped down the horse. Bogum saw that Tae was feeling a bit hesitant, so he held and caressed his hand to assure him that nothing will happen. \n“Its okay. He can’t hurt you, and I don’t think he will. But if he ever, I’ll just be behind the trees to save you.”—\nTae gave him an impish smile. Bogum turned the horse back then left. \nTae looked back to Jungkook who is currently facing his back at him. He probably did not know that Tae has arrived. \nTae was feeling so anxious, he was overthinking again. But maybe, they just need a talk.—\nHe slowly walked towards him, barely even making a sound. \nHe sat down at the edge of the cliff beside him. Tae did not look at him, because he was too scared that if he’ll get a glimpse of Jungkook, he might cry. \nJungkook saw him in his side perspective.—\n“The moon looks lonely...” Jungkook spoke, looking above the sky. \nTae looked up, he can feel the sadness of Jungkook’s voice. “I-It doesn’t. The moon had stars around him.” Tae commented. \nJungkook let out a sad smile, “You think the stars would make it feel less lonely?”—\nTae thought for a while, “Yes. Its better than no one was there with it.”\nJungkook was silently gazing at the sky. Tae got the courage to look at him, and he felt sadder when he saw Jungkook’s eyes glistening. \nIs he tearing up? “You’re right. Its better than nothing.”—\n“But don’t you think that the stars would just hurt the moon?” Jungkook asked, looking at Taehyung with unreadable gaze. \nTaehyung couldn’t understand what he was saying. \n“Why would the stars hurt the moon? They help the moon save the dark night.”—\nJungkook looked back up the sky. \n“The moon shows up first, giving light to the eve. Then eventually the stars will show up, making the night even brighter with its glow. But after hours, the stars will disappear as the sun rise. And the moon will be left alone again.”—\n“Then the moon will disappear on its own. Isn’t that sad? That the stars would suddenly show up in the midst of everything then disappear when things are getting fine?” \nTae was left with no words, he think that he knew what he was talking about.—\nJungkook looked back at him, a tear fell from his eyes as he spoke. “Are you the star, hyung?” \nHe asked, voice shaking in hurt. “Would you leave me too like how the stars did to the moon?” \nTae felt a pang in his heart. And bursted in tears, saying nothing but sobs.—\n“Because I’ve read things like this in the books. The one came from another world, then fell inlove with someone from the world it went. And then that person would have to leave, and everything would be broken.” \nJungkook said as he wiped his tears away.—\n“You’re from the future right? Will you leave me eventually? Would you need to go back to your place when everything is done?” \nTae couldn’t utter a word, he never cried like this just because of words. But now, Jungkook’s words hit different. \n“I hate you, hyung.”—\n“I hate you for lying to me. I hate you for being the only person who easily caught my heart. But I’m not regretting that I gave it to you.” \nJungkook’s tears were now falling continuously, he never cried like this before. \n“I’m sorry...” that’s what all Tae could say.—\n“It was too late for me to realize that I’m inlove with you. I couldn’t get the courage to tell you the truth because I’m scared of hurting you — only to realize that I’ll hurt you more if I keep lying to you.” \nThey were close to each other, but they felt so far.—\n“I did not even know that you’re not the Taehyung that I’m mad at. You don’t know how much my world shattered when I found out that you killed my brother, only to know that it was the other one.” \nTae couldn’t imagine how hard it could be for Jungkook that time.<br>—\n“I was split into getting my brother the justice he deserves, and coming back to you with open arms. I was so blinded by anger that I almost tried to kill you. I’m sorry, I’m sorry...” \nTae held Jungkook’s hand. “You did not know it wasn’t me, you don’t have to be sorry.”—\n“I’m sorry too, that I made you believe in a lie.” \nHe cupped Jungkook’s face and wiped the never ending tears away with his thumb. “I feel like a fool.” Jungkook said. \n“We’re all fools, just in a different way. Example, I’m a fool for you.” Tae cried and Jungkook giggled.—\n“You really said that?” Jungkook said, painting a little smile and smirk on his face. \nTae felt relieved that they’re beginning to be comfortable again, and the atmosphere is getting lighter. \n“But can you promise me one thing?” Jungkook asked.—\n“Promise me no secrets, and please, please...” Jungkook pulled Tae’s hand and held it like he never wanna let go of it.\n“Please don’t leave me. You’re the only one I had, so please promise me that.” \nTae gave him an assurance in his smile. “If you promise, then I will.”—\nJungkook finally held out a smile, “I promise.” Tae giggled. “Then, I promise too.” \nThey intertwined their pinky fingers as an assurance that they’ll held onto their promise. \n“Do you forgive me now?” Tae asked, since Jungkook still looks sullen.—\nJungkook’s expression went serious as he shake his head. “No.” He said. \nTae’s smile dropped, he felt a bit hurt and sad. But he can’t blame Jungkook, he’s hurt. \n“Its okay. I under—“ Jungkook cut him off. \n“Not until you give me a kiss.”—\nTae’s face literally lit up and his fave blushed a little. He was holding back his smile because he was feeling the butterflies wilding in his stomach.\n“What are you looking at? Come on, I’m getting impatient.” Jungkook joked as he pointed onto his lips.—\nWith all his smiles, the backed off the edge of the cliff for safety. Then Tae immediately aimed for Jungkook’s lips. \nFinally, finally they felt that electrifying feeling again. That butterfly effect in their stomachs are making them happy. \nThey missed each other, so much.—\nTae sat on his lap and Jungkook held his waist to guide him. Tae place his arms around Jungkook’s neck to deepen the kiss. \nWith that action, it made their night better. \nBut Tae forgot that Bogum was just there, hiding behind the trees, making sure that he’s safe.—\nBogum looked away, he caressed the horse and spoke with a tear falling down his cheek. \n“I think this is our cue to go, right Hara?” He talked to the horse. \nHe breathed in, to atleast calm himself and lessen the pain he’s feeling. \n“I’m okay, I’m strong right?”—\nHe laughed to himself as he wiped his tears. “Lets go home, baby. You need some rest.” \nHe said as he slowly lead the horse, and left the forest with a painful scenery in his head. \nAnd he felt even sadder, because he didn’t know if he can still fight the pain any longer.\n"},{"title":"81","data":"340.\nAs their kiss deepens, the amount of happiness were increasing too. \nThey don’t care even if this shit os an enigma in this era, they’re in their own world and no one can ever dictate them. \nThey both broke the kiss but Tae thought its over.—\nHe was surprised when Jungkook stared kissing his cheeks, then nibbled his ear. \nTae felt new to the sensation, but he wasn’t complaining tho. \nJungkook’s kisses trailed down his neck and started placing soft kisses there. \n“Mmh...” Tae let out a moan from his lips.—\nHe was looking up to give Jungkook more access. He gently pulled Jungkook’s hair to feel more of it. \nTae never felt this kind of feeling, the butterflies are hitting different and that electrifying feeling was even stronger.—\nHe was so lost on the sensation that he felt so confused and disappointed when the pleasure dropped. \n“W-Why did you stop?” He asked, breathing heavily with his face on flushed red. \n“It might lead somewhere, I shall hold myself.”—\nJungkook couldn’t help but to smile when he saw Tae’s disappointed but cute reaction when he stopped. \n“You need to sleep. Its almost morning, baby.” He said as he placed one last kiss on his nose. \nThey both got up and rode the horse where Jungkook got.—\nAs they take the way riding the horse, Tae was quiet. \nNot just because he’s reminiscing what happened lately but as he look at the quiet road, it seems different. \n“Did these...came from the foreigners?” Tae asked, silently worrying. \n“Yes, its bothering me.”—\nBecause they were taking the way in the capital, since its just 12AM, no one is still here and its very quiet. \nBut this market, the place, its not very traditional anymore. \nThe amount of new decorations and unfamiliar things convinced Tae that these aren’t from Korea.—\n“I sneaked in their national office when I was in US, I heard their plans — but not all.” Jungkook started. \n“They’re starting to migrate here, then eventually make Korea as their territory. And your father—“ \n“He’s not my father.” Tae said in pierce.—\nJungkook nodded as he acknowledge it. “Well, that motherfucker is helping them. And he’s really willing to sell South Korea to them as an exchange of being the president.” \nTae clenched his fists in anger, he can never hate someone else like this.<br>—\n“I hate him so much.” Tae said as he felt the tears on the side of his eyes. \nHe remembered the moment when his mother died in his arms. And its all because of Jaewon.\n“I heard what happened, condolence.” Jungkook said. \n“I’m sorry that I wasn’t by your side that time.”—\nTae immediately wiped his tears before it even fell. “You don’t have to be sorry. You’re doing this for our country too.” \nJungkook was silent, like he was thinking of something. “Hyung...can I ask something about the future?” \nTae felt nervous, but he still nodded.—\n“Me...what will happen to me?” \nFor Taehyung, that was the most painful question that Jungkook would ever ask him. \n“Jungkook...I-I don’t think you should know...” Tae said sadly, with that — Jungkook knew the answer already. \n“Will Korea be saved?”<br>—\nTae sucked the insides of his mouth to prevent himself from crying again. Because his heart just had too much pain for today. \n“Will my efforts be worth it? Will the future acknowledge the importance of loving their mother land?” \nTae did not answer, because he’s too scared.—\nWith the silence reigning over them, Jungkook decided not to ask more. Because he thought, that he knew the answer. \n“Hyung...” Jungkook called, Tae was looking down as he felt so hurt. \n“What is a vibrator?” Tae’s tears immediately backed off when he heard that.—\n“H-huh?” Tae asked, voice shaking in nervousness. \nAh, here we go again. \n“I saw it in your bag. I was really curious of that but I did not touch it. What’s it used for?” \nTae gulped and felt the heat on his face. What’s he gonna say now? \n“I-Its used for cooking.”—\nJungkook got a bit interested since he somehow likes cooking. “Cooking? That’s cool. You should teach me how to cook using it, someday!” \nTae laughed to himself, its real hilarious since he really doesn’t have any idea about it. \n“Hey, can we go somewhere?” Tae asked.—\n“Can we go to the cemetery? I want to visit my mom with you.” Tae said. \nAnd Jungkook did not hesitate on saying yes. He can feel how lonely Tae is now that his mother is gone. \nBecause he also felt the longing for a mother’s love.—\nWhen he was 5, and his brother was 12, their mother left them in the arcades. \nStarting from there, Jungkook had never gone to arcades anymore since it reminds him of how their mother left them. \nBut because of Taehyung, he gathered all his courage to finally face it again.—\nHe wasn’t mad about their mother, he was just sullen because she left them at such a young age. \nHis brother became a father figure to him because they never met their father. \nAs Jungkook grew, he looked up to his brother because of all the sacrifices that he did.—\nAll they had was each other, they were living happily until one day — his brother went missing. \nA fifteen year old like that time could never be more worried and scared of what the future has offered for them. \nBecause he found out that the only family he had, was killed.—\nHe promised himself out of anger and hurt that he’ll make the person who killed his loved one suffer to death. \nIt could never hurt more when he found out that it was Taehyung all along. But atleast, luckily, it was the other one.— \nThey arrived at the cemetery, and it wasn’t really scary. It was just peaceful and quiet. \nTae crouched in front of his mother’s tomb, Jungkook stood beside him. \n“Hey mom...” Tae called. “I know its late, but remember what I promised you before we went to the market?”<br>—\nTae’s voice was shaking, and Jungkook could never feel more hurt. \n“I’m here to fulfill that promise,” Tae held Jungkook’s hand and pulled him to sit down with him. \n“You told me that you wanted me to tell you about us, and now I’m here...but you’re gone.”—\n“And yes, I admit now that I do, your son is inlove with another guy. Mom, you don’t know how happy I am knowing that you accept me as who I am. And it made me more happy knowing that someone supports us.” \nJungkook held his hand and caressed it to make him feel his comfort.—\n“He made me realize so many things that I never thought I will. I thought no one would ever love me because of my sexuality but then he came. He’s a wonderful person mom, I’m so sad that you’ll never meet him again.” \nJungkook pulled Tae’s head over onto shoulder as he cried.— \nJungkook placed a kiss on his head as he felt his tears coming up. \nHe envy him, so much. Because he thought that Taehyung must be so lucky to have a loving mother that he’ll never have. \n“I miss you mom, I hope no one’s hurting you up there anymore.”—\nAfter minutes when Tae calmed down, Jungkook had enough of the drama. \nHe wanted to see that smile again of Taehyung’s face, the sweet and wonderful smile that can immediately make his day. \nAnd he’ll do everything to keep that in his face.—\n“Ma’am...” he called as he was looking at the tombstone. \n“You’re son is head over heels for me, can you believe that? He told me he wanted 5 kids and 2 chickens—“ \nTae immediately smacked him in the arm, and Jungkook laughed. \n“Shut up! I never said that!” Tae cried.—\n“What? Its true! You told me you wanted 5 kids and 2 chickens—“ \n“For your information, its flamingoes, not chickens.” \nJungkook laughed out loud that wrinkles are starting show from his face. Tae laughed too at his own words.—\n“But ma’am, I just want to ask you something in advance.” Jungkook said as he went serious. \n“I wanted to let you know that I’m gonna have to kneel in front of your son with a ring on my hand.” \nJungkook held Tae’s hand. Tae was so overwhelmed that he couldn’t even blink.—\n“It may not be today because I don’t have the ring yet. But I will marry your son even if its forbidden. I will make him mine and mine only for the rest of our lives. And make him the happiest person ever to exist in this vague earth.”\n(Ill post the other part like tommorow😊)\n"},{"title":"82","data":"—\nTears fell out from Tae’s cheeks, but now — its all because of happiness. \n“And I will make sure to give him 5 kids and 2 flamingoes.” \nTae laughed out of nowhere, he looked like a crazy shit laughing and crying at the same time.—\n“You’re hilarious.” Tae said as he smacked Jungkook’s chest. \n“I’m not kidding! I’m serious!” Jungkook said as he tried to pull out his serious face out of laughing. \n“Are you really gonna marry me?” Tae asked, feeling so excited. \n“And If I am?”[ TIME SKIP BECAUSE IM EXCITED ]—\nAfter some cuddling moments, they finally arrived at the place where Tae told Jungkook he stays — Bogum’s house. \n“You stay here?” Jungkook asked as he helped Tae hop down the horse. \n“Yeah, Bogum’s family is really nice.” Tae said.—\nEven before knocking, the door opened and it spit out Bogum who’s shirtless, and he looks like his sleep was interrupted. \nJungkook immediately pulled Tae over and hid his face onto his face to prevent him from seeing it. \n“Put your damn shirt on!” Jungkook ordered.—\n“Jungkook, its okay. I’ve seen it when you guys did a sparring right?—“ \n“Still, you should only see mine.” Jungkook whispered. \nBogum came back with a shirt on and bowed down as an apology. “My apologies, sir.” Bogum said with his hoarse voice.—\nJungkook let go of Taehyung who was holding back his laugh. \n“Thank you for today Mr. Park, and I hope you don’t go around him without a shirt on.” Jungkook’s voice sounded strict but Tae thought its cute. \n“Sir, yes sir!” Bogum’s voice cracked because he just woke up.—\nTae bursted on laughter, and Bogum somehow laughed at himself too. \nWhile Jungkook, he wasn’t amused. “Kim Taehyung,” Jungkook called and it made Tae froze. \n“Are you good here? You can stay in my house since no one is there.” Jungkook offered, sounding worried.—\nTae insisted, “I’m totally fine here. Besides, wouldn’t it be suspicious if they see a trainee staying at a Captain’s house?” \nJungkook thought about it, and maybe Tae was right. “Fine, but I’m one call away if you need me, okay?” Jungkook said.—\nAnd since Bogum wasn’t looking, Tae took advantage of it and placed a quick kiss onto Jungkook’s lips. \nIt made the younger smile. \nThey bid goodbye to each other and Tae finally went inside. \n“I’m glad you guys are okay now.” Bogum said as he lie down the bed.—\n“Yeah me too, it really made my heart lighter. Thanks to you too.” Tae hugged him as a thank you. \n“Welcome, you should sleep now.” Bogum said, Tae noticed something. \n“Are you okay? Why are your eyes red? Did you cry?” Tae asked. \n“No, I had allergies. Goodnight.”\n\n                                <img

\n<br>343. \n“What do you call a cat who stood in the middle of the road with furious vehicles?” \nTae asked Bogum, he was hopping as he walk. “What?” \n“Brave.” \nTae let out a loud laugh because he thought that his own joke was funny. But Bogum just let out a chuckle.—\nTae noticed it, so he gathered himself again and tried to think of another joke. \n“Why do bees have sticky hair?” Tae asked, its 4 in the morning and they’re going to the camp for trainings. \n“Why?” \n“Because they use honeycomb.”—\nOnce again, Tae let out a loud laugh. But he thought that maybe, he’s the only one entertained by his jokes. \nBecause he’s been so suspicious of Bogum. Since last night, his eyes were puffy and sore like he cried, but Bogum told him that it was just allergies.—\nThen this morning, he was even more suspicious because Bogum isn’t talkative.\nUsually every morning, Bogum would either surprise him, or make loud noises just to wake him up.\nBut this morning, Tae woke up by himself, and not even a single noise from Bogum.—\nTae decided to stop, maybe he’s making Bogum uncomfortable. But he actually just wanted to make him laugh because he’s not used to this side of him. \nThe rest of their walk was very quiet. Just the sound of people talking around are making it less tranquil.—\n“You don’t seem okay.” Tae said, he did not bother to ask if he’s okay be cause he’s obviously not. \n“What do you mean? I’m perfectly fine.” Bogum responded, but the loss of energy in his voice is not making Tae convinced. \nTae sighed, maybe Bogum wanted some privacy.—\nThey arrived at the camp. Same old routines in trainings. Their sessions had became more intense since they’re going to graduate very soon. \nTae haven’t seen Jungkook around, but he understood. He just came back, and maybe there’s alot on his hand right now.—\nIt was already afternoon when Tae heard some fuss in the hallway. \nSome soldiers were gathered in there like there’s some news going on. \nTae was to lazy to socialize with them so he just ran to Namjoon who was fixing his bag in the corner.—\n“Hyung! What’s going in there?” Tae asked and sat on the bed. \nNamjoon took a look at him, and even just by their eyes meeting, Tae could already know that there was something. \n“I guess he haven’t invited you yet.” Namjoon said as he fix his clothes.—\nTae cocked an eyebrow in confusion. “Invited? Who?” \n“Its Seokjin-hyung. He’s giving out invitations for his wedding day.” \nTae’s eyes bawled at what he heard. “W-wedding day? He’s getting married?” \nHe was hesitating to ask.—\nNamjoon nodded, “There he is.” He simply said as he saw Seokjin entering the room. \n“Taehyung! I was looking for you.” Seokjin said, and his expressions changed when he saw Namjoon on the side. \nHe looked anxious. \n“Hyung, you’re getting married?” Bogum asked on the side.—\nSeokjin pulled out a smile. “Yes, I’m inviting all my close friends here, so I’m inviting you both too.” \nTae and Bogum met eyes, because they both know that there was something going on in between Namjoon and Seokjin. \n“Sure! Congrats on your marriage.”—\nHe gave them both their invitations then left. \nBogum and Taehyung went to the corner to talk. “How is Seokjin hyung getting married to somebody else? Its obvious that he likes Namjoon hyung!” Tae cried. \nBogum shrugged. “Tae, Seokjin hyung came from a high profiled-family.”\n"},{"title":"83","data":"—\n“The children doesn’t have the right to reject the parent’s plans for them. Love doesn’t matter, they only care about their wealth and reputation.” Bogum explained. \nTae sighed, that was really unfair. \nWhy would you force someone to marry another that they don’t love?—\nThey both looked at Namjoon from the distance who was still fixing his things, he looks so sad. \n“I know there’s something wrong, Namjoon hyung is so quiet since this morning.” Bogum said. \n“You too! You’re so quiet today, what happened?” Tae asked.—\nBogum giggled when he realized that his own words was thrown to him. “I’m fine, there’s just days like this.” He said. \n“Let’s cheer him up, it must be so hard for him.” Tae cried. \nThey both went to Namjoon and sat in his sides. “What?” Namjoon asked.—\nHe was surprised when the two squeezed him in a hug. “Hey! What the??” He cried and the two even tightened their hug on to annoy him.\n“What is this?” Namjoon laughed as he thought that it was ridiculous for a man being hugged by another. \nBut he also felt pity for himself.—\nBecause he knew that falling inlove with the same sex is an enigma, &amp; yet he did. \n“You can do this hyung, okay?” Bogum cheered him up. \n“Everything happens for a reason, you just need to sit there and ready yourself.” Tae cried. \n“Yes, coz this thing requires strength.”—\n“It’s just very simple. You can handle this.” Tae said and smiled like ‘:3’\n“U just need to ready the ingredients,” Tae said.\n“Pour the 1/4 water—“ Tae cut him off. “Hey! Where did the water came from?” \n“U mentioned ingredients, I thought we’re discussing about cooking?”—\n“I was referring to the ingredients as his courage! Do you not get metaphors?!” Tae cried and Namjoon laughed at the both of them. \nThey both smiled at the sight knowing that they successfully cheered him up. \n“High-five!” Tae raised his hand for a high-five.—\nBogum went loading first, but he really doesn’t know what that thing is. “H-high-five?” Namjoon was confused too. \nTae realized that they have no idea about it so he just high-fived with himself an laughed awkwardly. \n“Ahahahahahaha, nothing.” Tae cried.—\n“But, thank you guys for comforting me. It really helped.” Namjoon smiled, and gave them a thumbs-up. \n“You just admitted that you have feelings for—“ Tae immediately covered Bogum’s mouth before he could finish. \nIts quite dangerious. “Shhh, idiot.”—\n“Oh, oops.” Bogum pursed his lips when he realized it. “Well, I think you guys know already tho.” \nNamjoon shrugged. “But hyung, he’s feeling the same for you. Why not try fight for your feelings?” \nTaehynug suggested, but it just made Namjoon sadder.—\n“What can a small insect do against a frog?” Namjoon asked. “Who am I against a wealthy and known family? They’ll just call me a dirty rag.” \nTae felt speechless. \n“Its okay, I’m fine. Thanks to you both.”\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/7a5fd7ad117a6523ad789d92b21a4cd11cd6564a/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f4149746976587557444c356230773d3d2d313131343232353431382e313639613737633266656634353233353934383332303135333438312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\"”\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/25dc2bd8635a3547d17591b41ac87992c485179a/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f50687354563168654a48496847673d3d2d313131343232353431382e313639613737633339316537663063623933343839353133393736372e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"494\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/3661588b31bb8a79161073ed4c27c3e75ee6a85d/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f374e744838395a5f444f564c61513d3d2d313131343232353431382e313639613737633430393639616438393239393033313836393839382e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/e57e14a4c8ce5073f9081f8254e42c6f930314e2/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f747856526f4f78574377624254773d3d2d313131343232353431382e313639613737633437326562306637393333373432393830333234312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\"345\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n345. \nThe evening passed, and Tae was still looking for Jungkook whom he haven’t seen all day. \nTae was standing in under the tree where he and Jungkook used to meet. \n“Psst.” He heard from behind. He looked around but there was no one. \n“Jungkook?” He whispered.—\n“Hyung! Over here!” Jungkook was almost whisper-shouting. Tae saw him hiding in between the gaps of the walls near the office. \nIt was quite dark so anyone an barely see them. \nTae quickly went towards him. “Where have you been? I missed—“—\nJungkook quickly covered his mouth by his hands and held him close as he heard someone was passing by. \nThey’re almost not even breathing because of the fear of being caught. \n“I need the information in the lockers room tomorrow.” A voice spoke.—\n“Sir, those info were confidential—“ \n“What rank are you? I don’t remember but you’re basically lower than mine. So you don’t have the right to talk back.” \nTae couldn’t see the faces, the voices weren’t familiar either. But he knew that they’re planning something back.—\n“S-Sir, yes sir!” With that, the shadow went away, meaning that nobody is there anymore. \nJungkook let go Taehyung who was somehow in shock. “We’re you spying on them?” Tae whispered. \n“Not really, but they’re suspicious so I did.” Jungkook sighed.—\n“I don’t like the sound of this. I don’t know what theyre planning so I’m quite nervous.” Jungkook added, the light of the moon hit his face and he looked so stressed. \n“Anyway,” Tae was surprised when Jungkook pulled him close and gave him a quick kiss. \n“I missed you too.”—\nTae giggled at what he said, “I did not expect that.” \nTae leaned in for another kiss, but they were both startled when someone called Jungkook over from the distance. \n“Captain!” In surprise, Tae immediately pushed Jungkook on the ground and faced the wall.—\n“There you are! I was looking for you. I need to discuss something with you...why are you on the floor?” Lieutenant Kang asked as he saw Jungkook sitting on the ground. \n“Oh, I was admiring the grass. Beautiful isn’t it?” \nLieutenant Kang got a bit confused.—\n“Grass...yeah so...beautiful.” He cried, he looked up to see Taehyung facing his back on him and looking at the wall. \n“Mr. Kim?” Lieutenant Kang cried, Tae looked back to him and gave him an innocent smile. \n“Oh, Lieutenant Kang! I didn’t see you there!”—\nKang cocked a brow. “Why are you still outisde? And why are you facing the wall?” \n“Oh, I had insomnia. I was entertaining myself by counting the ants. They’re 613 in total.” \nJungkook looked down and bit his lip to hold his laughter. \n“Oh...impressive.”—\nLieutenant was very weirded of them, I mean, why would you admire the grass? And who the fuck counts the ants just to sleep? \n“Anyways, have a good day to you two.” \nHe dared to leave but Jungkook stopped him. “Wait, are you gonne leave already?”—\n“Yes, do I have any other business with you?” Lieutenant asked. \nJungkook shook his head. “None. I was just wondering if you wanna admire the grass with me?” \nTae almost let out wheeze, but luckily he held his laughter. \nLt. smiled awkwardly. “No, thank you.”—\n“How about counting the ants, sir? Its really fun.” Tae suggested. \nLt. laughed awkwardly. “Haha, maybe some other time.” He said then quickly left. \nBoth of them looked at each other then bursted in laughter without a sound. \n“Did you really count the ants?”—\n“I did, its for acting purposes.” They both laughed together. \nThey both sat under the shade of tree and talked about a lot of never ending things. \nHalf were making out, half were just laughing and talking. They’re really enjoying each other’s company and comfort.—\nWithout knowing that there was someone from the very distance hiding in the shadows. \nHe saw everything. \nHe smirked and smoked his tobacco cigarettes. “Look at this two sodomites. How disgusting.”—\n“I finally have someone to use against you, Jeon Jungkook.” He said as he threw the used cigarette on the ground. \n“Just wait, I will make sure to drain every bit of you.”\n(Sorry if am not going to post a part these days after this cause another busy time sorry but ill update if i can thank you 😊)\n"},{"title":"84","data":"347.\nIt was just another day of training, same routine, same everything. The trainees are slowly fixing themselves since its just almost less than a week until they can finally graduate.\nBut for Bogum, it was a really hard day for him.--\n\"Are you avoiding Taehyung?\" \nHe thought no one has noticed, but as Seokjin asks him, he just shrugged and laughed to himself. \"What does it look like?\" \nSeokjin cocked a brow, inspecting every inch of the younger. \"Well, you're a bad liar.\"--\nYes, yes was the answer but he couldn't get to say it because he's really not sure of what he's doing. \nAfter everything that he saw in the forest that night, he's never felt so worthless and pathetic. He realized that maybe, it's time for him to let go of his feelings.--\n\"Is it obvious?\" Bogum covers his fists with cloth for boxing. \"Is it obvious that I'm avoiding him?\"\nSeokjin nodded, \"As I both know you, I've observed that you're quite distant from him since yesterday.\"\nBogum turned around and took a look at Tae from the distance.--\n\"It maybe obvious for you, but Tae hasn't noticed. I'm glad he hasn't, because I don't know how to answer him if he ever asks.\" \nSeokjin looked at Tae too who was busy socializing with other trainees. The big and radiant smile on his face was very evident.--\n\"Must be hard competing with Captain.\" \nBogum's head shot up with a surprised expression. Seokjin laughed as he was expecting that reaction. \n\"Come on, It's obvious. There's something in between the three of you.\" Seokjin said and Bogum lowered his head.\n\"Yeah, it's hard.\"--\n\"I mean, It was so pathetic of me to think that Tae will choose me after being on his side all along. But he still chose Captain,\" Bogum let out a painful laugh.\n\"I'm not mad at him, he's inlove with Captain and not me. So it's just understable that he'll still choose him.\"--\nSeokjin sighed as he felt the sadness in the younger's voice. He's never gonna understand the pain of not being the second option, because he's never been inlove with anyone.\nBut his eyes lingered on Namjoon who was quietly practicing his tactics from the distance.--\nTheir eyes met, and Seokjin immediately looked away.\nHe's still feeling guilty about not even telling Joon what he felt for him. It was evident in their eyes, and yet they still can't get to speak for it.\n\"So, you plan to avoid Tae until your feelings for him disappears?\"--\nBogum nodded, coz he doesn't know if he'll take long. He still likes Tae, and he knows its hard to take back those feelings. \nHe promised himself that he'll still be there whenever Tae needs him, but not the same.\nBecause you know...the strongest person can get tired too.--\nSeokjin sighed, \"I don't think that's a good idea.\" He suggested, and it immediately caught Bogum's attention. \n\"Why not?\"\n\"You'll just miss him. Your feelings will just grow bigger the longer you avoid him. But it's still up to you.\"--\nThere was suddenly a fuss in the hallway. It's actually not a big deal since its not a fight, but still, curiosity led them to it.\n\"What in the world is that?\" A soldier asked. The other one was holding a daguerreotype-like object.\n\"This is a polaroid film.\"--\n\"I bought it from the market.\" The other trainees started inspecting the polaroid out of confusion. \"Isn't this a daguerreotype?\" \n\"No! This is better than that!\" He cried as he defended the object.\n\"You got this from the market? I've never seen this.\"--\n\"Seriously? This is brought by the Americans. Their things are really amazing.\" He complimented. \nBogum's eyebrow cocked. \"Our daguerreotype is amazing too. That polaroid is just improved.\" he cried.\nThe others glared at him like he said something offending.--\n\"Are you nuts? Do you see the difference between that cheap shit and this?\" The trainee talked back.\nAnd Bogum couldn't understand his point, because it was bullshit. He couldn't believe that his fellow prefers other country's products than their own.--\n\"Let's just say that both products are wonderful. Case closed?\" Seokjin said and he pulled Bogum out of that crowd.\n\"I don't get them.\" Bogum spoke out of frustration. \"The Americans just came last week and they're already having transactions here?\"--\n\"I'm tired of it too, I just saw the Capital and it looks totally different.\" Seokjin said.\n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"The banners aren't written in hangul anymore. It's something in english. And people are selling more American products than Korean.\"--\n\"It's really frustrating, they already got influenced within just a split second.\"\nBogum went silent with all the informations. He suddenly remembered what Taehyung told him about the future. \nHe felt worried as he thought that maybe it's happening.\nWell, it really is.<br>[ TIME SKIP BECAUSE I'M EXCITED ]--\n\"BOO!\" Tae laughed as he successfully surprised Jungkook from behind. It was already night, and they're both in their usual meeting place.\n\"What was that for?\" Jungkook cried as he catch his chest. The shine of the moon was their only light since it's already dark.--\nAnd the light contrasting with the darkness was enough to make them feel safe in against the world. \n\"Nothing, you look so serious. Is there something you wanna tell me?\" Tae asked as he sat beside Jungkook under the shadow of the tree.\nJungkook shook his head. \"None.\"--\nHis eyes lingered on Tae's hands who was holding a cellphone and another odd object. \"What is that?\" Jungkook asked.\n\"Oh this!\" Tae started. \"This is an earphone.\" he showed Jungkook the thing and he looked like an 11 month old baby who's inspecting the thing.—\n“What is this used for?” Jungkook asked. Tae did not answer and just grabbed the earphone from him. \n“Here, I’m gonna show you.” He plugged the earphones into his phone and scrolled down his music library. \nHe’s glad that it wasn’t deleted.—\nHe held Jungkook’s face onto the side so he can easily put the earphones into his ears. Jungkook was weirded of the object in his ear. \n“Is this safe?” He asked as he felt like it was tickling his ear. Tae laughed at his innocence. \n“Yes, I often use this to escape reality.”—\nTae had the other part of the earphone in his ear. He tapped on a specific song and Jungkook was surprised when he heard something from the earphone. \nBut instead of being weirded about it, he went silent as he was attentively listening to the song.—\n“Loving can hurt~...loving can hurt sometimes~...” \nTae smiled as he heard of this song again. He doesn’t know but it hits so differently, it felt so magical.” \n“But it’s the only thing, that I know~...”—\n“When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes~...” \nIt was very relaxing for the both of them. Living was most tiring exercise to do, but having each other’s side reduces the pain. \n“It is the only thing makes us feel alive~...”—\n“We keep this love in a photograph, we made this memories for ourselves~...” \nTae felt Jungkook’s hand on him, he gently pulled it to his side and held it with his both hands. \nHe was leaning onto the trunk of the tree with his eyes closed.—\n“Where our eyes are never closing, hearts are never broken, times forever frozen still~..” \nTae gathered himself close to him and laid his head onto his shoulders. He’s never felt so comfortable and at ease with a person. \nHe just hoped that they can stay like this forever.”—\n“Hyung...” Jungkook called, his voice a bit tired. \n“If you ever go back to the future one day, I’ll wait for you. I’ll wait for you to come back again.” \nTae felt a shot in his heart when Jungkook said those.\n"},{"title":"85","data":"—\n“Don’t say that...” Tae cried, his voice was shaking. “Why not? I just wanted you to know that if ever time takes us apart, I will still choose you. I don’t see it the other way.” \nTae closed his eyes as he felt tears starting to appear again.—\n“I couldn’t imagine our kids running around the house without thinking that you’re my spouse.” \nTaehyung giggled at his words, his tears suddenly back out. “Kids already? We’re not yet even married.” \n“Says the one who told me he wanted 5 kids and 2 flamingoes.”—\nTae laughed. “But what if...” \n“What if I don’t come back?” Tae asked, and Jungkook went silent. Tae was somehow regretting that he asked the question, but Jungkook spoke. \n“Then I’ll wait for another you. I don’t want any other else, I want it only you.”—\nTae just smiled and did not answer. He was too overwhelmed, he can never get enough this man. \nJungkook liked the song, so they listened to it repeatedly, until Tae was surprised when Jungkook unconsciously sang along with it. \n“OMYGOD?!” Tae cried.—\nJungkook flinched at his reaction. “What?” \nTae smacked him in the arm with an unbelievable expression in his face. “You can sing!” Tae cried. \nJungkook’s ears went red as Tae said those. “I-I can?” He asked. \n“How do you not know? God!” Tae cried. “Your voice is heaven!”—\nJungkook smiled shyly, he’s not really used of these kinds of compliments. \n“You should sing more! I can’t believe you have a wonderful voice.” Tae said, still looking so amazed. \n“Should I make you a song then?” Jungkook suggested.—\nTae got excited at his suggestion. “Really? I dare you!” Tae cried. \nJungkook shrugged. “I accept the dare.” He giggled, so many thoughts are running in his mind about the possible lyrics of the song. \n“But with a condition.” Tae was silenced with Jungkook’s words.—\n“What condition?” Taehyung asked, he suddenly felt nervous. \nJungkook puckered his lips and closed his eyes. Tae realized it and laughed at his silliness. “You can’t take a day without a kiss, cant you?” \nJungkook laughed. “You like it too, idiot.”—\nTae stood up on his knees and sat on Jungkook’s lap for a better access of the kiss. \nTheir lips were almost meeting until Tae’s phone rang, Jungkook was surprised and somehow annoyed. \n“Oops, sorry.” Tae cried and took his phone from his pocket.—\nHe took a look at the notification and it was an alarm from the calendar. \nHis expressions immediately dropped to negative zero when he saw what it was.\nIt means...\n\n                                <img

\n"},{"title":"86","data":"352. \nWhile Jungkook was busy supervising the training in the camp, he stopped when he saw Lisa holding something on her hand. \nEveryone greeted her, knowing her father’s position in the military and government. \nLisa greeted back, painting a sweet smile on her face.—\n“You can go Captain, I can handle this.” Captain Hugo whispered as he greeted Lisa too. \nThey both went into Jungkook’s office since it looks like Lisa has something important to say. \nShe gave him a big notebook, “What is this?” Jungkook asked.—\nHe opened the notebook and it was full of calculations of sales. \n“As to what you can see, the American’s are starting to take over Korea. The sales of foreign products are higher than our own. Plus, the illegally exported products aren’t included yet.”—\n“No one is even speaking about it, not even the government. Some are noticing it but they’re too afraid to be called out.” \nJungkook continued flipping the pages to review everything.\nHe heaved a sigh and gave it back to her. “I already did something about that.”—\nLisa shot a brow, “Mind telling me?” She asked, Jungkook shook his head. \n“I can’t yet, let’s just say you’ll find it out by yourself soon.” Jungkook said, Lisa crossed her arms across her chest. \n“Whatever you’re doing, I hope its not something that can put you in danger.”—\nJungkook chuckled like Lisa was joking. “Isn’t being in danger a part of my job?” \n“You’re a soldier and even a Captain, the opponents can shoot you easily. But thats not what its like now that you have Taehyung.” \nJungkook was silenced.—\nA knock on the door was heard, and it spit out Bogum who was carrying a height of papers on his hand. \nHe immediately went frozen when he saw the two. “Oh, my apologies, sir, maam—“ \n“No, it’s okay. You can come in.” Lisa said.—\nBogum hesitantly entered the room, he was quite intimidated of Lisa because of her beauty. \nHe placed the papers on top of Jungkook’s table. “Lieutenant Kang sent those, he also asked me to tell you that he needs you in the inspection later.” \nJungkook nodded.—\nBogum was about to leave when Jungkook stopped him. “Mr. Park, please accompany her to the gate.” \nBogum got a bit flustered but he eventually bowed. “Sir, yes sir!” \nLisa glared at Jungkook because maybe, she knew what he was trying to do.—\nLisa and Bogum left, and as how Jungkook instructed him, he escorted Lisa towards the gate. \n“Are you an introvert?” Lisa asked while walking, “No ma’am.” \nLisa chuckled at the formality, “As far as I know, I’m younger than you. So quit the formality.”—\nBogum didn’t know why he was flustered. Maybe because Lisa sounds very different from any other girls. \n“Okay bestie.” It made Lisa laugh. “Bestie? What a funny word to hear from a man.” \nBogum scratched his head out of embarrassment. His humor really comes out of nowhere.—\nBecause of that, they’ve talked about things, especially their lives. And Bogum unintentionally asked her about her love life, knowing that his fiancée is dead. \n“Oh, I didn’t mean to—“ Lisa shook her head and smiled, “It’s okay, he deserves to die.” \nBogum was surprised.—\n“Oh uh, well I found out that he was just using me for money.” Lisa started, looking down her hands because she was still sensitive about that. \n“He’s such a dick.” Bogum cried and Lisa nodded. \n“Yeah, all men are dogs.” \n“Meow.”—\nLisa shot him a surprised and confused look. Bogum realized what he just did. \n“I mean, not all men.” He giggled. They finally reached the gate and Lisa thanked her. \n“You’re fun, I hope we’ll meet again.” She smiled and left.—\nAs soon as Bogum came back to their room, they were all talking about something but he couldn’t understand. \n“Have y’all read the book?” \n“Yeah I did.” \n“What book to be specific.” \n“That mysterious one.” \nBogum frowned at their topic, he was suddenly curious.”\n—\n“I really think the writer has a point.” \n“Me too, I think the foreigners are taking advantage of us.” \nBogum was just silent in the corner, but his ears were sharp in hearing that he could hear their conversation from a distance. \n“That book is a talk everywhere.”—\n“It’s not surprising. The writer is a genius. I mean, how did we not notice everything?” \n“I wonder who the writer is. Its only the pen name written.” \nBogum caught Taehyung in the corner, sitting silently and staring at the blank space like his thoughts were deep.—\n“I hope he’s okay.” Bogum whispered to himself. \nMaybe Seokjin was right, he thought. Because even afterall his efforts of avoiding Tae, his feelings for him never went away. \nIt just grew.\nHe hated himself for falling inlove with the person who’s inlove with someone else.[ TIME SKIP BECAUSE IM EXCITED ]—\nKnocks were heard on Jungkook’s door. He was currently staying at his house since Lisa had some other business. \nHe lazily got up from the chair and went to the door to see who it was. \nIt was already 9, and he wondered who the hell would visit him at this hour.—\n“Hyung?” Jungkook was surprised when he saw that it was Taehyung. \nIt was snowing cold outside, and even though Tae was covered in thick clothes, it wasn’t still enough since he have low tolerance in the snow. \nJungkook quickly let him in. “Why did you go out while snowing?”—\n“I-I...I wanted to see you.” Tae excused. The real reason, he was afraid that Jungkook might disappear since later is New Year. \nPeople are just inside their houses eating and waiting for 12 to finally celebrate New Year. \n“Baby, its snowing. You might catch a cold.”—\nHe quickly led Tae infront of the fireplace to make him feel warm. \n“I know, but I wanna spend the New Year with you.” Tae said and gave him a smile. \nJungkook felt his heart jump because Tae is acting cute again. “Unfortunately, I don’t celebrate New Year.”—\nTae cocked a brow, “Why not?” Jungkook shrugged. “I mean, I do. But this upcoming year, I don’t feel so good about it.” \nTae sighed, then pulled out a smile. “Don’t be so negative. It’ll bring you bad luck.” \nTae pulled out a bracelet from his pocket.—\n“I bought this lucky charm earlier. I hope it’ll bring you luck.” He put the bracelet on Jungkook’s wrist. \nJungkook giggled. “I don’t need this. You’re my lucky charm.” \nTae held back himself from smiling again, because he just too overwhelmed.—\n“Look Gukkie, we’re matching bracelets!” Tae giggled and showed Jungkook the other bracelet on his wrist. \nBut the matching bracelet isn’t the one who made Jungkook flustered. \n“W-What did you just call me?” He asked, his expression not readable.—\nTae felt anxious. “I called you Gukkie...i-is there something wrong?” He asked. \nJungkook was silent, his ears having the touch of pink as he gulp. “N-nothing, hold it, I’ll just take a shower.” \nTae felt like laughing on what he just saw.—\nBefore Jungkook could even leave, he saw that something was pent up in his pants. \nTae pursed his lips to stop himself from laughing. “Are you sure you’re gonna take a bath? Its cold.” \n“Yeah, it’ll be fast.” Jungkook shouted from the distance.—\nAs soon as he heard the Jungkook is finally in the comfort room, he let out a laugh with no sound. \nHe was almost crying in laughter, because he thought it was hilarious, and cute at the same time. \n“Did he just get turned on by the nickname I gave him?”\n"},{"title":"87","data":"\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/ffa8fab3dde5630706cbe31918e045163dec5b30/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f5a526e6370765253394a38316a413d3d2d3130382e313639653162663839616462646261613334343837373935383039352e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/61f8f50bb53f7ad8b7b6f29e4779b519021f0f24/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f5f4a366e354279434f37582d6f513d3d2d3130382e313639653162663932613134666165613330303831303037313834302e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/5cbe11371e72258fb9b56b465a2f0228193facea/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f3336356653766b785f33624743673d3d2d3130382e313639653162663962323739653432633133343734303238343733352e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"494\" alt=\"354\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n<br>354. \nWhile Jungkook was busy in the comfort room, Tae decided to take a little inspection on his house. \nWell, he’s been here — but that wasn’t a very good encounter back then. \nWith the taste of sophistication and traditional style, his house was beyond beautiful.—\nIt was simple, yet very pleasing in the eye. Tae didn’t know how to appreciate traditional houses back then since he thought that there’s nothing special. \nBut now that he have Jungkook, now that he’s fallen inlove with everything in 1894, he couldn’t be more in awe.—\nTae’s eyes led to Jungkook’s desk, where his office was in the room between the living room and the kitchen. \nIt was very messy, full of papers and other things. He sighed, even if its a holiday, Jungkook is still working. \nTae went towards it.—\nAnd his eyes immediately caught the handkerchief laying down beside the penholder. He had a quill, and a ballpoint pen which was invented in 1888. \nHe smiled, knowing that Jungkook was keeping it. And he couldn’t be more happy knowing that he’s treasuring it.—\nThe papers beside the typewriter were the next to catch his attention. There are words written on it, and Tae can clearly read it. \nHis brows furrowed with what he saw. “What is this for?” He asked himself.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/854b38fbe294faad22911d2e424d3dc3b86efbe0/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f444b5763753047315732564368673d3d2d3130382e3136396531626664643130306561326635333432363230383134382e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"1080\" data-original-height=\"1713\" alt=\"355\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n355. \nTae scattered the papers so he can read it all. But even if he can, he couldn’t understand what’s it all for. \n“Why is he writing this?” He asked himself. \nHe sighed, giving up with his brain. He trusts him, he know he’s doing this for something good.—\nHe saw a purple notebook placed near the hanky, but it wasn’t the same notebook that Tae was aiming before. \nHe got curious and grabbed it, opened it only to see the that the first page has his name written on it.\nHe didn’t know, but his heart jumped.—\nHe flipped the page, and he saw there are words written. It was arranged like verses and stanzas. \n“That faint voice of yours that grazed me, please call my name one more time. I’m standing still under the frozen light, but I will walk towards you, step by step. Still with—“—\n“Hyung?” He almost jumped in his place when he heard Jungkook’s voice from the distance. \nHe quickly put back the notebook and arranged everything in their place then acted like nothing happened. \n“Is the water cold? Why would you bother taking a bath on winter’s eve?”—\nJungkook smiled &amp; looked away out of embarrassment. He’s now neatly dressed with his casual clothes, &amp; his hair was beautifully touching his face. \n“Do you want coffee? Or something warm?” Jungkook asked as he went to the kitchen. \nTae shook his head, “No thanks, I’m good.”—\nWith that, none of them spoke. And Tae finally realized what he just brought to himself. \nBecause its night, and they’re both alone. Isn’t that awkward? \nJungkook couldn’t calm himself, so he’s somehow taking himself away from Tae because he’s quite worried.—\n“Why are you sitting far from me?” Tae asked, looking at Jungkook who was silently staring back at him in the kitchen. \n“H-Hyung...I-I’m scared.” Jungkook muttered in his weak voice. \nTae was somehow worried, he thought Jungkook had no fears. “What is it?”—\nJungkook looked like he was hesitating. But he eventually shut his mouth. “Nothing, never mind.” \nTae laughed. “Come on, what is it? And why are you over there? Do you not want me here? Just tell me, I’ll leave—“ \n“Hyung, I’m scared okay?” Jungkook cried.—\n“Then what’s it about? Tell me?” Jungkook gulped, his ears were tinted with pink, and he looks so flustered. \n“I’m scared that I might do something dangerous when I come close.” He said with his voice a bit low, he’s feeling quite shy. \nTae was frozen.—\nBut he thought, that maybe its quite fun to take advantage of this time. \nMaybe pull a prank on him? Tae thought. \nWith slow steps, Tae started to walk towards him, keeping their eyes locked. \n“Tae, what are you doing?” Jungkook asked as he felt quite nervous.—\n“What? I’m not doing anything.” Jungkook thought that Tae would come on his direction but Tae quickly shifted directions. \nAnd Jungkook felt quite disappointed. \nTae went to get a glass and poured some water on it. \nJungkook looked back at him, feeling confused.—\nTae drank the water, purposely looking up to expose his neck to him. \nJungkook gulped at the sight, but he couldn’t take his eyes off him. \nTae put the glass down, lips swollen with the water effect. “Your water tastes good.” \n“What does it taste?” \n“It tastes like water.”—\nJungkook chuckled, he’s didn’t know what to react anymore. \nTae ran his fingers through his hair and pulled off his most charismatic look. \nJungkook’s smile disappeared, and Tae felt intimidated when Jungkook clicked his tongue. \nYikes.—\n“Are you trying to seduce me, Kim Taehyung?” \nTae gulped. Because maybe, he knew he fucked up since Jungkook is calling him by his full name now. \n“No? I do that normally.” \nTae didn’t know if Jungkook was smirking or he was sarcastically laughing.— \n“Do you do this normally?” Jungkook stood up and slowly walked towards Tae without cutting their gaze. \n“And this?” He grabbed the glass that Tae drank on and poured water on it. He drank it and purposely exposed his neck while drinking. \nTae gulped.<br>—\nHe finished the water and licked his lips to drink the remaining liquid. \n“And this too?” He ran his fingers through his hair, and even if he’s not trying, Tae thought it was hot. \nTae was about to take a step back but then he felt counter behind. Oops.—\nJungkook went forward, placing his both hands on both sides of Tae so he was locking him. \nTheir faces inches apart, and gazes locked. “Answer me, do you do that normally?” \nTae couldn’t think of an answer. “W-Well I—“ \n“You should only do that to me.”—\nTae was surprised when Jungkook held his waist and carried him on his shoulder. \n“H-Hey! I’m sorry, I was playing around okay?!” Tae cried as he kept hitting Jungkook’s hips to put him down. \n“Ah!” Tae cried when Jungkook laid him on the bed.—\n“You think I was playing around?” Jungkook asked, hoping onto the bed, leaning forward. \nWith no warning, he quickly aimed for Tae’s lips. It was just normal for them, but this time, Tae felt that the butterflies were intensified. \n“Mmhhh...” Tae cried in between the kisses.—\nJungkook bit Tae’s lower lip and that made a moan escape his mouth. He took it as an advantage to explore their own with their tongues. \nIt was a moment of making out, when Tae felt that different butterflies again when Jungkook started kissing down his neck.—\nTae was very lost into the sensation and felt very confused when Jungkook started laughing. \n“H-huh?” Tae asked, feeling so disappointed when the pleasure dropped down. \n“I’m sorry hyung, I was playing around too.” He laughed and place a kiss on Tae’s nose.—\n“I know you’re seducing me, so I played around too.” He said with his laughters. \nTae did not hesitate to pull him by his collar and kissed him again. \nJungkook was so surprised, but he eventually got lost in the kiss again. What do you expect? Tae makes a big impact on him.—\nIt was another moment of kissing and touching, when Tae broke the kiss. \nHe cupped Jungkook’s cheeks and their foreheads where against each other. \n“Jungkook...” he called. \n“Hmm?” \n“Make love to me.”—\nEyes shot wide within surprise, Jungkook can feel his heart beating so fast. \n“W-What?” Jungkook asked, finding the joke in Tae’s eyes. \n“You heard me.” \nJungkook slowly, pulled away, not wanting to give Tae the wrong thought.\n—\nHe wanted to speak, but there was nothing coming out from his mouth. He was too surprised. \n“I’m not forcing you if you don’t want to. But I just wanted to know what you feel.” Tae cried, feeling a bit anxious. \nJungkook sighed, he held Tae’s hand and caressed it gently.—\n“Hyung, It’s not that I don’t want to—I mean, if you’re feeling pressured because of what I did, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean too.” He placed a soft kiss on Tae’s hand to make him feel less uncomfortable. \n“I’m not pressured, I meant what I said.” Tae said in a low voice.—\nJungkook was left with no words, he wasn’t expecting this. \n“I don’t know what to say. I don’t want you to think that I’m taking advantage of you. Baby, I respect you &amp; I love you. I promised myself to only touch you after we get married.” \nTae giggled at his words.—\n“Are proposing to me indirectly?” He asked, Jungkook laughed a bit. “Yes, but there’s no ring yet. Would you accept it?” He played around. \n“Then let’s get married now!” Jungkook laughed at Tae’s cuteness, he didn’t know if he’s this innocent or is he just inlove with him.—\n“But what if...” Tae paused. “What if we don’t get married?” \nJungkook couldn’t utter a word out of confusion. He let out a nervous chuckle. \n“Baby, you’re scaring me. Please don’t say that.” Jungkook held Tae’s hand tighter out of fear.\n"},{"title":"88","data":"-\n\"I'm just trying to see things.

He's seen this before, but it still doesn't fail to amaze him.-\n\"No backing out.\" Jungkook pulled out a playful smile on his face as he toss his shirt onto no one knows where. \nTae felt a huge wave of butterflies and tingles in his insides. He knew he won't regret this. \n\"Let's make the winter hot, shall we?\"\nWarning 💦18+ <br>(This is mature content if ur uncomfy then skip but i know u guys arw not innocent like me 😏 so wish u all

about 9 in the morning, there are no trainings since its weekends and its a holiday.—\nThe first thing that his eyes landed on was the most beautiful human he’s ever seen. \nTae’s was beautifully sleeping beside him, blankets covering the both of them and both are still naked. \nJungkook smiled, he’s not really like this in the morning.— \nBut you know, he just realized that it felt so good waking up in the morning, and the first thing you is the person who you love the most. \nHe shifted positions to examine Tae’s features clearly, and you know what? Even in his sleep, Aphrodite would be so jealous.—\nHe gently tucked Tae’s hair falling on his face behind his ear to see his face clearly. Jungkook slightly brushed Tae’s hair with his fingers. \nHe’s so fond of him. \n“Can’t wait to wake up to you everyday after our marriage.” He cried and smiled to himself.—\n“We’ll build another house, we’ll live there together with our adopted children. We’ll take care of them and I’ll make sure a happy ever after for us.” \nHe said, looking directly to him while he’s sleeping. \nHe stood from the bed, opened his cabinet to get something.—\nHe smiled to himself, then looked at Taehyung with eyes full of love. \nClothes on, he held the engagement ring on his hand, and put it inside his pocket. He felt so excited. \n“I’ll propose to you when you wake up, I’m not letting you go anymore.”—\nHe took a quick bath, and checked on Tae to see if he’s awake. And he’s still asleep. \n“I must’ve tired him last night.” Jungkook scratched the back of his head as he laughed quietly. \nHe went to the kitchen to prepare their breakfast.—\nHe had just placed the food on the table, when a knock on his door was made. \nHe immediately went to the door to answer it, he opened it and it spit 5 unfamiliar soldiers, but he can confirm that most of them are American.—\nJungkook felt a bit confused, because its very rare for him to get a visit from his fellows. \n“Yes? What can I do for you?” He asked, pulling out his professional him. \n“First of all, happy new year Captain.” The soldier on the front said.— \n“Second of all, I’m Colonel Hank. And we’re to ask you to go with us in the police station.” Hank showed him the warrant of arrest and inspection. \n“We need to inspect your house.” Jungkook glared at them, he felt nervous but he’s too professional to show it.—\nJungkook moved to the side to let them in, “Go on.” \nAll of them went in and started inspecting everything in Jungkook’s house. \nJungkook was quite confident knowing that they won’t find whatever they’re trying to.—\nJungkook saw Hank open the bedroom door, and he knew that he saw Taehyung. \nBut Jungkook had his ways. “Stop right there.” He said, and it caught all of their attention. \n“Who is that person right there?” Hank asked, referring to Tae who was covered under the blanket.—\nHis face wasn’t visible, since he was facing the side, and the blanket was keeping him covered from them. \n“That’s my wife.” Jungkook said. \n“Wouldn’t it be such a pervert and disrespectful of you if you’ll go in an inspect her?”—\nHank glared back at him, stopping on his tracks from going in further. He looked at the person on the bed. \nEven though he was feeling a bit suspicious, he closed the door back and did not go in. He’ll be in trouble if he goes in with a woman naked. \nWoman, he thought.—\nAfter a few minutes, “Clear sir.” The other soldier whispered to Hank. \n“We have to go now, Captain—“ Jungkook cut him off. “Wait, I’ll just write a letter to my wife.” \nThey watched him enter the room, and they knew that he won’t escape since his wife will be in danger.—\nJungkook quickly pulled out a paper and wrote a short letter to Taehyung. \nAfter that, he went outside and shut the door. \nHank chained his hands and they finally went out to the police station. \nBut plot twist, \nThey did not take him to the police station.\n(ok bitin muna dto kasi i have a busy days am so sorry guys pls.vote 💗)\n"},{"title":"90","data":"(Hi guys sorry if am not updating because am too busy streaming 'LALISA' MV lisa solo is already came pls stream it on youtube spotify and digital stores nation wide and ofcourse 'MONEY' also)\n\n                            <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                              <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                            </span>\n                            <iframe data-video-id=\"awkkyBH2zEo\" width=\"764\" height=\"330\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/awkkyBH2zEo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" id=\"widget2\" class=\"initialized\" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1_19=\"true\"></iframe>\n                          \n\n                            <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                              <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                            </span>\n                            <iframe data-video-id=\"08x_TcTyw8o\" width=\"764\" height=\"330\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/08x_TcTyw8o?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" id=\"widget4\" class=\"initialized\" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1_19=\"true\"></iframe>\n                          \n<br>Anyways back to the story i bet you guys are exited mee too hahah \n361. \nIt was Tae’s turn to be waken up by the sun, the rays are hitting his face likes its telling him to wake up now. \nTae was half awake, eyes still closed with feeling of sleeping again. He turned around, patting the space beside him. \nIt was empty.—\nHe opened his eyes in curiosity, he looked to side to see that Jungkook is really not there. \nHe felt a little thump in his heart knowing that today is New Year, and something bad might happen. \nHe sat upright, but he immediately groaned. \n“Ah...”—\nHe held into his hips, tint of pink rushing to his face as he remembered what happened last night. \nWell, he isn’t regretting. \nEven though his insides we’re quite sore, his body painted with a few love marks. \n“Fuck, I think I can’t walk.”—\nHe told himself as he held onto the bed for support. But even before he could even stand, his eyes landed on piece of paper on the bedside table. \nHe quickly grabbed it and read it.\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/9930e82b1f4c8e80b3a7990979f8d2bc1002718a/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f5a62374e484f74585472363468773d3d2d313132393233333639362e313661343631613337373263366235653135383230383239383038382e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"1080\" data-original-height=\"1080\" alt=\"He quickly grabbed it and read it\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n363. \nTae felt a bit relieved at his letter. He really hoped that Jungkook is doing fine, coz the worry is still lurking in his heart. \nHe managed to get up even though his legs were wobbly. He went to take a bath. \nHe was actually looking for his top but he couldn’t find it.—\n“Where did I throw it? I’m sure I just placed it here.” Tae said, he’s already wearing his pants, the top is the only one missing. \nIt was a minute of searching in the house, until Tae gave up. \nHe sat on the bed, frustrated about the shirt. Until he saw Jungkook’s closet.—\n“It won’t be bad if I borrow a shirt from him, right?” He asked himself as he open it, and rummaged in. \nHe picked a simple white shirt. It was a bit bigger than his size, but it still fits him. \nHe went to the kitchen and saw the food that Jungkook prepared.—\nHe ate the food while smiling. Weird you thought? I mean, inlove people randomly smiles even if theyre taking a poop, so yeah...weird? \nHe cleaned everything before he leave the house. \n“Did you that awhile ago?” \n“That’s scary.”—\n“Why did they chain Captain?” \n“I wonder what happened.” \n“Oh! A new part of that mysterious book is published!” \n“Really? Let me see!” \nThe people around Tae we’re talking about those two topics. Like almost everyone around him was looking at a paper.—\nBut Tae was so lost in his thoughts about Jungkook so he didn’t hear and notice what’s happening in his surroundings. \nHe was casually walking down the busy street until he finally arrive at Bogum’s house. \nHe saw Bogum’s mother come out.— \n“Oh, Tae you’re here!” She greeted while carrying lots of fruits in her basket. \nTae smiled and greeted back. “Happy New Year, auntie.” \n“We’re actually waiting for you last night so we can eat together with the guests. But Bogum told me you went to a friend.”—\n“Ah, yes. Sorry, I went to a friend and stayed the night there.” Tae apologized. \n“Its okay. Can you wake up Bogum for me? That kid isn’t coming out yet, its already 10!” After that, she left. \nTae quickly opened the door to their shared house.—\nHe saw that he was lying down the floor, hugging a pillow. He was sleeping. \nBut as soon as he opened the door, the light outside hit his face and it woke him up. \n“Tae?” Bogum asked with his hoarse voice, eyes adjusting to the light. \n“Why are you sleeping on the floor?”—\nHe helped him get up. “You told me you’ll come back yesternight. I waited for you.” Bogum cried. \n“I’m sorry, I decided to stay in the house since it’s snowing.” Tae looked behind him. \nAnd while that, Bogum’s eyes lingered on Tae’s neck.—\nHis heart broke as he saw a love mark. Because maybe, he knew what happened. \n“D-Did you make that?” Tae asked, referring to the well set-up table and some foods at the kitchen. \n“Well, I was planning a simple date with you last night. But I guess, you were busy.”—\nTae felt so guilty about it. “Lets eat it! Come on, it looks delicious—“ \n“No, you can’t eat this. Its cold and spoiled now, I’ll just cook you a new one.” Bogum said as he carried the plates with food towards the trash. \nTae couldn’t utter a word, he felt like a bad person.—\nBogum did not speak, he was just quiet while washing the plates. Because he thought that once he speaks, he might burst in tears. \n“I’m sorry....” Tae said, staying the back while watching his fellow. \nBogum didn’t want to answer, but he doesn’t want Tae to feel bad either.—\nSuddenly, the door was kicked and it was forced open. Two men covered black went in the house. \n“Who the fuck are you?” Tae cried, slowly stepping back in fear. \n“Tae, watch out!” The guy was pointing a gun at Tae, but he shot it at Bogum’s knee. \n“Ah!”—\nTae cried at the gunshot. Bogum fell on the ground while holding his bleeding knee. \n“BogummRFHFHDHD!” The other guy pulled Tae towards him and covered his mouth. \nThe grip was too tight that Tae couldn’t even escape.—\n“Shit—!” Tae bit the hand hard and that made the guy let go of his mouth. He elbowed him on the stomach and he was on the floor. \nTae ran towards Bogum, trying to aim for the knife to fight it against them. \nBut it was too late.—\nBecause he forgot that there are two culprits. \nThe other guy pulled the trigger and something hit Tae’s neck. It was a tranquilizer. \nTae fell on the ground unconscious because of the shot. Bogum grabbed the knife above him and threw it towards the guy.—\nIt was stabbed on his thigh and he’s crying in pain. But he still managed to shoot Bogum a tranquilizer and it also made him unconscious. \nThe other guy got up and carried Tae up his shoulder. \n“Are you sure we’ll not get him?” The other asked, referring to Bogum.—\nThe other one shook his head, no one noticed them and quickly put Tae inside the vehicle to hide him. \n“No, this guy is the only one that boss asked us to bring.” He said and rode the horse, away from no one knows where.\n(Congrats to bts for winning in MTV yay we did it armys and ofcourse IDOl for 1B views)\nIn other news \n(Lalisa mv already had 100M views and counting i hope you guys can stream it love you all and thank you for supporting this)\nMabuhay kayo hanggang gusto nyo! <br>Vote and follow!!! \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/6f3c519ad3bd5014a8ad07175750d6c6905ce778/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f6a486c564b594d696c58456366513d3d2d313132393233333639362e313661343631663138623463663338323539353431363334363938332e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"480\" data-original-height=\"396\" width=\"480\" height=\"396\" alt=\"Mabuhay kayo hanggang gusto nyo!

If you’ll obey me, you won’t be hurt anymore.”—\nJungkook was tied into a chair, both his arms and feet were impossible to be moved. \nAs the electrifying stopped, Jungkook was panting for his breathe. He felt exhausted with all the beating but at the same time, he didn’t want to give up. \nHe let out a sarcastic laugh.—\n“It was so pathetic of you to beg me. Now who do you think is the loser here?” \nJaewon felt so offended at what Jungkook said. He quickly flung a fist at his face and the younger fell on the floor along with the chair. \nOne more hit on the stomach, and Jaewon felt superior.—\nHe raised him up by his collar, looking at him eye to eye with anger. \n“Hurt me all you want, kill me if you can. But can never erase the fact that you’re the weakest person alive for teaming up with other nation just to put yourself on the top.” \nJungkook cried.—\nJaewon smirked, knowing that maybe, Jungkook would talk no more once he sees it. \n“I like the courage you have. I just hope you still have that shit once you see him.” \nHe threw him on the floor, but not hard enough for him to stumble again. \n“Get him in!” Jaewon cried.—\nThey were inside a room, there are no windows, and its barely even painted. There’s only one door, a light. \nIt looks more of like an illegal hiding place of gambled materials and illegally exported products. \nThere are also some of his people around to guard to place.—\nThe door opened, and it spit two people who was carrying somebody. \nHe was unconscious, mouth covered with a cloth, and they chained his hands up, and his feet down together so he can’t move. \nJungkook’s blood rushed through his head as soon as he saw who it is.—\n“What’re you waiting for? Wake that fucker up!” Jaewon shouted, voice sounding like a thunder. \nOne of his people grabbed the bucket of water and splashed it to Taehyung, making him wake up in shock, clothes were soaked too. \n“FUCK YOU! I WILL KILL YOU!” Jungkook cried.—\nJungkook was so angry that his veins we’re almost popping on his head and neck. He was like a roaring dragon who was ready to spit fire at any time. \nJaewon chuckled, a smile painting his face. \n“Why so angry, Captain? Isn’t he just a trainee of yours?”—\n“Mrfhdh!” Tae cried, but it was inaudible since he’s biting onto the cloth. \n“SHUT THE FUCK UP! YOU WANT ME RIGHT? JUST ME RIGHT? LETS SETTLE THIS AMONG US, LET HIM GO!” Jungkook used all of his strength in shouting. \n“Sorry, not sorry. But I don’t play fair.”—\nTae felt so scared and confused. He though Jungkook was doing fine, but if he haven’t been kidnapped yet then he wouldn’t know what’s really happening. \n“Boss, is he really a man? His body looks like a woman.” A guy said, and they all started laughing.—\nTae’s traumas are coming back again. He remember these kinds of things when he almost got harassed for having such a slim body like a woman. \nEven if he’s gay, he’s still a man in body. And he hated it the most when he felt like he’s being disrespected.—\nAnd you know what’s even worse? His clothes are tight on his curves now that its wet. \nJungkook was trying to escape all the ties just to swing a fist on them. “SHUT IT YOU FUCKERS!” \nJaewon didn’t care anymore. He believed, that he owned no child anymore.—\n“Mrfhrhffh!” Tae wanted to speak, and tell them that he’s not a fucking woman. He’s still a guy despite his sexuality. He hated them so much, so fucking much. \n“Why don’t you go touch him? He’s sodomite, I think he loves attention.” Jaewon told them.—\nJungkook was about to push the chair himself so that he can go to Tae, but these two guys were holding back the chair with all their might. \n“DON’T EVEN DARE LINGER A SKIN ON HIM!” Jungkook cried, he was so angry that felt a bit dizzy. \n“You think you can threaten them?”—\nThe other guy started to caress Tae’s legs, and Tae felt so disgusted at himself. \nYes, he sometimes acts like a feminine. All guys have their feminine side, but he just hated the fact that he’s being compared to a female just because of that. \n“Look what we have here.”—\n“I think I know who created this ugly hickey.” \nThe other guy said and pulled Tae’s collar a bit to expose his neck. “Pft, how disgusting.” \nThe other one was about to bite on Tae’s neck but his reflexes were quick and blocked it with his head.\n—\n“IF I GOT OUT OF HERE I’LL KILL ALL OF YOU!” Jungkook cried, still trying to escape the ties. \nTae was crying is anger, fear and disgust. Never in his life did he ever feel so useless. He couldn’t even remove their hands from his body and he hated it.—\nTae made the cloth on his mouth wet so he can easily push it down his mouth by his tongue. And he succeeded. \nThe other guy harshly cupped his cheeks with his fingers and was about to kiss him. \nBut instead of looking away, Tae spit on his face and it hit the guy’s eye.—\nJungkook smirked, he felt so proud of what his man did. But he know it wasn’t enough to stop those guys who’s harassing him. \nA hard slap met Tae’s face and it made him burst in tears. His cheeks we’re stinging. \n“How dare you spit on me?!”—\n“So...have you decided Jeon?” Jaewon asked, smoking his tobacco. \nJungkook felt like crying out of all the anger. His fists were clenching and his hands were almost bleeding because his nails were dug too deep. \n“There’s nothin to decide about, fucker.”—\n“Well then I’ll give you,” Jaewon started, signaling something on his people. \nThe guys grabbed the heated wax — it was so hot that It’s even smoking — and immediately dipped it onto Tae’s skin. \n“ARGH!” Tae groaned in pain, his skin is burning.—\n“You’ll drop everything you’ve got about our plans. You will keep quiet, and pretend that nothing happened. In that case, we’ll let go of Taehyung and you.” \nJungkook shed a tear as he watched Tae groan in pain, because he couldn’t even help him.—\n“But if you still plan to expose us, we’ll still let go of you, but Tae will have to stay, and he’ll suffer with us.” \nTae gathered all his strength to open his teary eyes, and looked at Jungkook eye to eye.\n“Choose the truth, don’t mind me...please...”—\n“So...what do you say?” Jaewon laughed, his voice is very irritating in the ear — like its the nails on the chalkboard. \nIf he hide the truth, him and Tae would live normal, and they’ll be fine together. But if he choose the truth, Tae will be in danger.—\n“AGH!” Another hot wax was pressed onto Tae’s skin. The burns are visible and his tears were nonstop. It was very obvious that he’s trying to endure all the pain. \n“Jungkook don’t listen to him! He’s trying to brainwash you—AH!” The wax was pressed hard on purpose.—\nJungkook’s mind is so messed up, he doesn’t know what to choose anymore. \nHe used to be so smart at this, he used to be so good at this but now that Tae is in the line, he couldn’t think well anymore.\nThe love of your life? Or your nation? Which would you save?—\n“I’m giving you seven seconds to decide...” Jaewon said. \nAnd Jungkook felt even more pressured. \n“One...” \n“Jungkook, listen to me...” \n“Two...” \n“This is about Korea, our motherland!” \n“Three...” \n“You’ll help a lot of people, I swear!”—\n“Four...” \n“What? You’re gonna choose me? Jungkook if you do that then you’re worse than this fucker!” \n“Five...” \n“I’m fine...I can endure this!The people needs you the most so please!” \n“Six...” \n“Jungkook please...listen to me...” Tae said in his weakest voice.\n“—\n“Seve—“ \n“Let go of him.” Jungkook said, eyes closed with his words. \nTae was shocked, his heart fell knowing what Jungkook’s decision was. \n“Jungkook no! Take back what you said!” Tae cried, managing his words as he felt another burning feeling.—\n“I’ll do as what you asked. Just please, let go of him, now.” Jungkook said, voice a but calmed down but his feelings were still in fire. \nA tear fell down his cheeks. He feel like the most pathetic person alive. \nBecause he promised to protect his nation, now what happened?—\nJaewon smirked and clapped. “Aww, our Captain has a soft spot for his fellow disgusting sodomite.” \nJungkook did not answer, he didn’t want to look at Tae because he didn’t want to see the disappointment in his eyes. \n“Okay, let of him.”—\nThey unchained Tae, and he immediately fell weak on his knees out of all the emotions and pain he felt. They carried him towards the door to get him out, but Tae looked back. \n“W-Wait, why is it only me? You said you’ll let go both of us!” \n“I told you, I don’t play fair.”<br>—\nTae was so angry, he tried to come at him but the two guys’ grip were too strong for him to fight. \n“I hate you! I hate you so much!” He cursed at Jaewon who seemed to not care. \n“Jungkook! Wait for me, I’ll get you of here! I promise!” He cried as he threw him out the room.—\nTae was about to run inside again but the door was shut right before he could even get in. \n“No! Let go of him!” Tae hit the door with his hands. He kept shouting and knocking until he felt so tired because no one was answering.\nThank you guys for supporting! \n"},{"title":"92","data":"—\nHe slid down the door, only sobs coming out of his mouth. He couldn’t even manage to speak because of his cries. \nHe was feeling even scared knowing this. And knowing he don’t know what might happen anymore. \nBecause you know what?\nThe New Year hasn’t ended yet.365.\n“Taehyung!” \nBogum can barely even walk, but he forced himself to get up just go to and give Tae a hug. Tae immediately bursted in tears, hugging him back and both falling weak on their knees.\n“Are you okay?—what is thi—DID THEY HURT YOU? DID THEY DO THIS TO YOU?”—\nBogum was in rage as he saw all the burnt marks on Tae’s arm, neck and legs. He even saw that his cheeks we’re red knowing that they slapped him.\n“Those fuckers!—“ Bogum tried to stand up to go and take revenge for Tae, even though he himself was still hurting.—\n“Bogum, calm down! Your injury might get worse!” Namjoon held him down and Tae was surprised that he’s here.\n“N-Namjoon hyung? What are you doing here?” He asked, as he saw that there’s already a bandage on Bogum’s knee.\nNamjoon handed Tae his cardigan to keep him warm.—\nBogum’s mother was also there, even his brother. “Bogum told us what happened, I almost fainted when I saw him lying on the ground. Good thing I saw Namjoon near our house, he’s the one who helped us.”\nBogum’s mother explained, and Tae was just quiet.—\n“What happened, really? Who are those guys, Tae? Why are they after you?” Namjoon asked.\nAll of them were quiet as they wait for Tae’s answer. But the questioned, couldn’t utter a word. \n“Let’s not ask him now. He’s probably traumatized.” Bogum told them.—\nWith all his thoughts, Tae stood up. He went to his backpack and grabbed a pouch.\nHe went back to the dining and gave Bogum the pouch. “What is this?” Bogum asked, feeling so confused. \nTae looked at Bogum’s mother, “Ma’am, you guys have to leave Korea.”—\nTheir brows furrowed at what he said. “Leave Korea? What is going on?” \nHis mother panicked, feeling so nervous as how Tae was acting. “This pouch is full of money that I saved. Its enough for you guys to buy a ticket for a ship towards Australia.” \nHe explained.—\n“Why do you want us to leave? Is there something wrong?” Bogum asked, feeling so worried. \nTae didn’t know what to say. He wanted to tell them, but he didn’t want to scare them. Because maybe, some things are better left unknown.\n“Tae, you have to tell us why.”—\nTae went silent for awhile. He didn’t want to say it, but he guess, he had no choice.\n“A world war is coming.” He started, leaving everyone in silence and surprise. \n“I can feel a world war is coming very soon”—\nA hand flung on Bogum’s mother’s mouth out of shock. Even Namjoon was surprised and worries. But Bogum, maybe he knew how Tae is seeing all these.\n“We’re not safe here unless the people realize that the Americans are trying to take over us.”<br>[ CHANGE POV : JUNGKOOK ]—\n“So, is this the fella you’re talking about?” \nA big raspy voice, and a very different accent was heard in the room. Jungkook wasn’t trying to escape anymore, now that he knew that Tae is somehow safe, he’s fine with that.\nBut you know, the games are not over yet.—\n“Yes General, I think his energy is drained now because he’s not that quiet awhile ago.” Jaewon said, throwing off his tobacco on the side.\nJungkook did not bother to look up. He was just looking down bis feet, while he feel his arms and legs getting numb at the ties.—\nA fist flung on Jungkook’s face so hard that he got thrown on the floor. He hasn’t even recovered yet when he got lifted up on the collar.\nAnd another fist hit his face as he hit the wall. His back ached as soon as the chair hit the block, creating a big impact on his body.—\n“Agh...” Jungkook let out a small groan. He coughed and coughed until there’s already blood coming out of his mouth. \nAnd none of them even flinched like they’re used to these kinds of setups.\nThe General of the Army lifted him up by his collar, examining his face.—\nBut Jungkook did not even bother to look at him. Because he couldn’t even open his eyes now out of exhaustion. \n“So, you we’re the one who wrote those shitty realization letters?” The General laughed sarcastically, \n“How weak of you to fight us using a pen and paper?”—\n“You didn’t even realize I was planning that, and now you call it weak? Hah, pathetic.” \nJungkook laughed, and everyone felt surprised that he still had the guts to talk back at his situation. The General quickly flung another fist and threw him on the ground.—\nJungkook was lying on the floor, body full of bruises. And he’s starting to cough blood now. “Let’s just kill him sir, in what way di you want? Burn him? Drown him? Tor—“\n“I wan’t all of them — but I want people to see his death — knowing that he’s a bad person.”—\n“They would actually just agree with us. Remember that time when we planned the attack on the plaza? The people are hating on him, there’s no way they’ll let him live.”\nEveryone in the room laughed at their plan, while Jungkook’s vision was spinning.—\nThe General washed his hands, not wanting it to be left stained by blood. \n“Later this night, gather everyone in the plaza. Make sure all his loved ones are around. Because I want to see the hurt in their eyes as soon as this fucker die.”\nHe went close to Jungkook.—\nStepping hard on Jungkook’s chest as he heard him groan, his breathing was already heavy like he was just trying to survive.\n“Even if you choose to hide it, I don’t like the way you’re talking. So get yourself ready tonight, because as soon as the sun sets — your life ends.”\n\n      <img

back to the story \n369.\nAt five, everyone gathered in the plaza, they don’t even know why they’re there. But they did not leave, wanting to know what the fuss is all about. \nBut there was a hug space on the center, where two soldiers arrived holding Jungkook who’s tied within himself.—\nHis head was looking down, the bruises and blood stains were visible around his body and clothes. \nHe was so tired — so exhausted — but it was not enough to send him down. He was still breathing, because he wanted to see his people, even before he dies.—\n“Oh God, its Captain!” \n“They’ve beaten him up that bad.” \n“What did he do?” \nPeople were starting to whisper with each other, not knowing the real deal with what was happening. \nJungkook was standing in the middle, as Reiner — the General of the Army — arrived.—\nHe hopped down the callesa, along with Jaewon and his two soldiers. \nTae arrived at the place, squeezing himself into the pool of crowd just to get to the front. \nAnd he felt so angry — so so angry that his emotions were turning into tears — when he saw Jaewon and Reiner.—\nBecause who wouldn’t be angry at such plastic inhumane beings? \nReiner pulled out a fake hurt face, while Jaewon was just in a straight face. \nTae wanted to run towards Jungkook and pull him out of that hell. \nBut he was too weak for that, his heart was too weak to move.—\nReiner went in the middle with his other ugly tentacles. Holding a megaphone in front of his mouth, he spoke with a hurt tone. \n“Today, we gathered all of you around for an important announcement.” He started. \nThe people’s murmurs are getting louder as they’re curious.—\n“This, Captain Jungkook, planned to set us up.” \nThe people were surprised at the words. Because they’ve known Jungkook for so long, how could he do that? \n“He wrote this book entitled ‘Touch me not’. Making up words against us to give us a bad image on the crowd.”—\nTae’s fist was clenching so hard that it was shaking. If only looks could kill, then that Reiner would’ve probably be lying now. \n“He made up stories about us in the book and insulted us. And all of those, weren’t true. Did we hurt you? All we wanted was to help!”—\n“And yet we’re being accused by something we did not even do.” Reiner pretended to wipe his fake fucking tears. \n“And today, I will be fair. I will let all of you decide his fate whether he dies or not.” \nThe people were talking to each other about their opinions.—\n“He should be killed!” \nA person shouted. “He’s an irresponsible Captain!” \nThe people murmured, and the shouts were getting continuous. \n“Yes, my son died because of his irresponsibility!”\n“He deserves to die! Where was he when we needed him the most?”—\n“He’s a hypocrite! Execute him now!” \nThe people started shouting and created a chant about the decision of executing Jungkook. Tae was so frustrated at them. \nHe saw a smirk slipped on Jaewon’s mouth, and Tae wanted to punch the shit out of him.—\n“Okay citizens, silence. We get your decision, and we’ll make sure that he gets executed—“ \n“Stop right there!” \nTae shouted in the midst of silence. Reiner stopped talking, and everyone was looking at Tae.\n“Pardon, mister?” \n“Let the people vote PRIVATELY.”—\nReiner’s brows shot up, “Privately?” He asked. “Why would we need to do private votings? When the result is clearly seen now—“ \n“Not everyone has the same opinion. Some are just dragged by other’s opinion and got scared to say theirs. People needs PRIVACY.”—\nJungkook was looking down, and even tho he feels weak, he still got to smirk because maybe, he knows what Tae was planning. \n‘That’s my man.’ He thought. \n“He has a point.” A person agreed. \n“It’ll be fair enough to hear both sides. Coz were basically doing MURDER here.”—\nThe people agreed, because maybe, they felt guilty with the word murder. \nReiner was so pissed knowing that he had no choice but to agree with the people.\n“Alright, give them papers each, a zero mark means you agree with his execution, &amp; a vertical line means opposite.”—\nEveryone started writing on their papers with the pencil. They placed their votes on a box and was about to count it when Tae spoke. \n“I don’t trust y’all with counting. Give me the box.” Tae ordered. Reiner wanted to smash his face, but the people are watching him.—\nTae started counting the votes, and he was right with the results. \n“20 people voted for execution, 46 people did not. See what I was trying to point out?” \nJaewon’s fist clenched in anger, he’s regretting his decision that he let go of Taehyung.<br>—\nJaewon went close to Reiner and whispered something, “Sure then, the results are ‘not to execute’ him. But we’ll let him go with one condition.” \nTae was frozen in his place, this is what he was scared of.—\n“2 teacups on the table — one contains belladonna, one doesn’t — he needs to choose one and drink it. If he survives after he drinks it, then he’s free.” \nTae thought it would be quite easy. But no. \nBecause a belladonna, is a fucking poison that can kill you within minutes.—\nAnd if Jungkook chooses and drinks the wrong teacup,\nHe’s dead. \n“I accept it.” Jungkook forced a voice out of his mouth. He was nervous, but he wanted to test them. He knew that Tae would say no. \n“No! That’s not in the plan!”\n“The private voting wasn’t in the plan too.”—\nReiner smirked, and Tae wanted to kick that shit out of his ugly face. \nBut he had no choice but to pray. \nA soldier sat on the table with Jungkook, he let the Captain choose his teacup. \n“Captain, choose wisely!” Seokjin appeared in the crowd, helping Tae.—\nJungkook was silently examining the teacups. Its really harder than he thought since belladonna has no color, and even smell. \nThat’s why he couldn’t identify which of the teacups has belladonna. \nBut with his doubts, he chose the teacup on the left.—\n“Is that your choice? Hope you chose the right one.” The soldier in front of him whispered like he’s not afraid of his life. \n“If that’s your final decision, drink it.” Reiner ordered. \nThe other soldier and Jungkook drank the tea at the same time.—\nEveryone was silent as they were thrilled. Jungkook said something to the other soldier but no one heard. \nThe soldier stood up and went towards Reiner, everyone was shocked when he suddenly choked the General.—\n“YOU WILL...DIE!” The soldier shouted while tightening his grip on his neck. \nThe soldier suddenly fell on the ground, as the blood came out from his nose and mouth. \nEveryone was shocked. And Tae felt quite relieved.—\nBecause when you drink a belladonna, you will have hallucinations, and people can order you around before you die. \nTae smiled and the crowd cheered. “He chose the right cup!” \nTae felt like crying in happiness.—\nJungkook stood up, feeling a bit dizzy with his wounds. \nBut everyone was surprised, \nWhen he fell down the ground, with blood coming out from his nose.\nOk na!

The first thing he saw was Namjoon, and Seokjin, then Bogum. \n“W-Why?”—\nNamjoon pointed onto a direction with his pout. Tae turned, and couldn’t feel more joy when he saw that Jungkook has finally opened his eyes. \n“Jungkook!” He cried and quickly stood up, cupped the younger’s face out of disbelief. \n“Hyung...” Jungkook mumbled.—\nHis eyes looked heavy, and he can barely open it wide. \nThey were inside Jungkook’s house — in the bedroom specifically. \nAfter Jungkook passed out, the authorities were certain that he did not survive even if he chose the right cup.—\nBut the proof that Jungkook was still breathing gave them hope. So they brought him to his house for a rest, a doctor with them too. \nHe was asleep for hours, and his heartbeat was irregular. There are actually times where his breathing would suddenly stop.—\nBut now he’s here — he’s awake. And all of Tae’s fears and doubts were crushed.\nThe doctor came up to them, it was Seokjin who called it with them because his family has a position in the medical field. \nThe doctor checked his pulses, even his breathing.—\n“He’s not yet stable, but better than earlier.” She said, as they look into Jungkook. \nHis breathing was still heavy, and even tho his wounds are already bandaged, it still looked painful. \n“How are you feeling?” Tae asked with his soft voice.—\nJungkook paused for a little, taking breathes. “My vision is spinning, and my head hurts. But it’s bearable.” \nHe said with his weak voice. He closed his eyes again as he saw images spinning. \n“I was right, both cups have belladonnas.” The doctor said.—\nAll of them looked surprised, but Jungkook spoke. “Yes, they lied. Both cups have belladonnas.” \nTae didn’t see this coming, but he knew that there was something odd. Because Jaewon wouldn’t offer it, if he knew that they won’t have a win with it.—\n“I just chose a cup based on the color of it.” He explained even tho he’s still feeling dizzy. \n“It was a miracle that you survived.” The doctor commented. \nSuddenly, the door flung open and it made all of them flinch.—\nTrails of tears on her face, Lisa went forward, and flung a smack on Jungkook’s arm. \n“Ouch! What the fuck?” Jungkook cried in pain. \n“Don’t ‘what the fuck’ me Jeon! You almost died and I don’t even know?!” Lisa cried and hit him once again.—\n“I’m alive okay? Calm do—ouch! Stop it you psycho!” \nThey’re like siblings whose fighting over who’s the most favorite. \n“I told you to be careful didn’t I? I didn’t even know you wrote that goddamn book?!”—\nBogum held her back, and Jungkook was really thankful for that. “I told you calm down, I was gonna tell you eventually.” \nLisa frowned him, wanting to hit him more out of annoyance. But she was just actually worried, because Jungkook was like a family to her.—\nLisa just left, and Bogum went with her to calm her down. \n“You should rest first, we’ll just go outside—“ Tae said and they were about to leave when Jungkook spoke. \n“Don’t.” But the three just smiled when they saw that Jungkook was referring to Tae.—\nA hand holding him back from leaving. He was lying down the bed. \nTae felt a bit conscious since he thought that Seokjin and Namjoon didn’t know what’s between them yet. \n“Uh—“ \n“Its okay, your secret is safe.” Seokjin flashed an assuring smile.—\nThe door shut, and it was just the silence left. \nJungkook did not let go of Tae’s hand, he looked onto the burn marks that was on the elder’s arm. \nHe sighed. “I’m sorry.” \nTae sat beside him on the bed, caressing the younger’s hair.—\n“I’m sorry that I couldn’t do anything when they were hurting you. I’m sorry that I—“ \n“You’re not on fault. I’m okay, I can bear this. Drinking a poison was more dangerous. I’m sorry, because of me you had to do that.” \nJungkook slowly adjusted on his position.—\nNow, his head was resting on Tae’s lap. “You said you’re dizzy bur you managed to shift positions.” He laughed. \n“I wanted to see your face.” Jungkook added, and forced to open his eyes. \nTae leaned forward, placing a soft kiss on his forehead.—\n“I thought I was gonna lose you.” Tae’s voice was shaky. “I was so scared, you don’t know how much.” \nTae held his hand and placed it near his chest. “I might go crazy if I loose you. So please, be careful. And I’ll always be here for you.”—\n“I can’t die yet.” Jungkook started, \n“I still need to marry you. Give you a family and a good life. I can only die after I do that.” \nTae was too overwhelmed on his words. But he didn’t want to hear more of it. Because he hated promises, \nthat are meant to be broken.—\nHe hated that maybe one day, he’ll just have those promises as memories in his mind. \nHe hated that maybe his dreams with Jungkook would one day be just a dream. \nHe hated everything that was set before them. \nBecause what if...what if fate had other plans for them?<br>—\n“You should rest for—....” Tae was cut off by no one but silence. \n“Tae?” Jungkook called, feeling odd about Tae stopping in mid sentence. \nBut even if its just silence, Tae felt like he was battling with someone inside him. \n“A-agh...” he groaned, and held onto his head.—\n“Hyung what’s happening?” Jungkook opened his eyes to check on Tae, and he felt worried when he saw that he was holding onto his head. \n“I-It hurts...so bad....” Tae was almost even crouching out of pain. \nHis head felt like it was being crushed.—\nThere’s also a throbbing pain like his head was beating. He felt like it was going to explode. \nHe felt a little dizzy and he didn’t know why. He felt like something else was trying to fight him. \n“Tae what is it? What’s going on?” Jungkook was so worried.—\nWithin just a split second, all the pain in his head went away. \nTae opened his eyes, feeling everything around him. It was very odd. “Its gone...” he muttered. \nJust a few seconds ago, his head was so much in pain, and now its all gone like nothing has happened.\n\n      <img

of myself-\" \nTae hushed Bogum who's still not over on debating with him -- whether he go to Australia with his family, or he stays in Korea.\n\"You have no choice. Plus, you'll be much safer there.\" Tae flashed his sincere smile.--\nBogum's reaction was not readable. It's like he's thinking something deep. \n\"But if I go to Australia...\" Bogum paused, fidgeting on his fingers because he was anxious.\n\"Who's gonna take care of you? It's not like Captain can keep his eyes on you all the time.\"--\nTae had thought of that too. He's actually scared of being alone -- especially the feeling that you're the only one left in the world. \nBut he didn't want to be selfish -- if he did, then his friend's life would be in danger.\n\"U don't know how to cook, how r u gonna eat?\"--\n\"Who will wake you up in the morning? Who'll save your ass when you're in trouble? Who's gonna scold you when you're being stubborn? Whos--\"\nTae giggled at his cuteness, but it also hurt his heart coz he'll miss those.\n\"I can handle myself, don't worry.\"--\nThey're actually in the port, waiting for the ship towards Australia. Bogum's mother and his brother was on the bench sitting and waiting.\nTae had convinced them to go coz it's also for they're good. There's no way he'll let them stay knowing the danger in the situation.--\nBogum went silent, and looked away towards the sea. \nThere we're so many people, but the reflection of light and the sea we're very visible in Bogum's eye because he was tearing up.\nTae felt sad too, so he hugged him from behind for a comfoot.--\n\"Don't cry! I might cry too!\" Tae chuckled as he lean his head onto Bogum's back. \n\"I was just scared.\" Bogum's voice was shaky, but he was trying to manage it. \"Why?\"\n\"What if this is our last meeting? What if we'll never see each other again after this?\"--\nTae was silent, just thinking of the possibilities is hurting him enough.\n\"Don't say that, we'll still meet!\" Tae cut the hug and cupped his face jokingly to cheer him up. \n\"What if I come back, only to find out that you're back in the future? Tae I feel so sad.\"--\nA tear rolled down Bogum's face, and the tear on his left eye fell first -- symbolizing pain.\nAnd it was more painful for Tae because Bogum was the last person he'll ever want to see crying. And Tae doesn't know how to answer.\n\"If that happens, please don't forget me.\"--\n\"I don't want to leave.\" Bogum said once again, and Tae giggled because he's trying to start a debate again. \n\"I'm sorry, but you have to.\" He squeezed his cheeks and smiled at him to cheer him up. But it just made Bogum more sad because what if he never see his smile again?--\nIt was just a few minutes, when a staff of the port shouted that the ship to Australia has arrived. \nBogum's hand tightened his grip on Tae like he didn't want to let go. And Tae thought that he's like a baby, its cute.\nBut the pain was more dominant.--\n\"Taehyung, please take care of yourself.\" Bogum's mother gave him a one last hug. Bogum's little brother saluted to him.\nAnd Bogum, was obviously holding back the wave of his tears. \nThe hopped aboard on the ship, and Tae hated this feeling of someone leaving.--\nIt felt like deja vu because this also happened when he sent his siblings off. And he promised himself, that this would be the last time he'll feel this.\n\"If you see my siblings in Australia, please give them the letter I wrote!\" Tae shouted, as he watch the ship go.--\nAlong with lots of people saying goodbye to their loved ones, he felt like he's alone again. \nJust like how he felt on the rest of his life. But you know, you gotta be alone to figure out better things.\nTae closed his eyes as he feel the breeze brush on his skin.--\n\"I can feel the ending, and I hate it so much.\" Tae whispered to himself with his shaky breath. \nHe sighed, and slowly left the port with a heavy heart.\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/3fa313613528e1373cf5af3e6289d51d1e1b80ed/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f743352375a5049345275572d6e413d3d2d3131362e3136613632393666626430616335396239323931313738383633312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"Ok maikli lang toh kasi half a sleep pa ako so ayan na maya na lang ko itutuloy \">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \nOk maikli lang toh kasi half a sleep pa ako so ayan na maya na lang ko itutuloy \nAs always vote and follow\nAnd \nMabuhay kayo hanngang gusto nyo!\n"},{"title":"96","data":"Hi beautiful creatures tangina kung meron kayong links sa bts in the soop and Bts Permission to dance concert let me know pls kapag meron sa inyo mag update talaga ako marami pls pls well thx advance\n376. \nTae went back home, but it wasn’t the same anymore. Because it was too quiet for him to be familiar with it. \nBack then, whenever he leaves then comes back, he would either see Bogum doing whatsoever or see him peacefully sleeping on the bed with a loud snore.—\nBut now, its just the silence. \nHe sighed as he closed the front door. The room looks lonely without Bogum and his family. \nBut Tae thought that he needs to get used to it. \nBecause from now on, he’ll be living all alone by himself.\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/edd4a64b84f40cfe9b2801d255152eaaf7a21a26/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f3553783744464b612d7771396f413d3d2d313133323133373038392e313661363836613866363761353437623337353832343930373334312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"Because from now on, he’ll be living all alone by himself\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n377. \nHe went to open the cabinet, where the rest of the ingredients were. He was very unlucky that there was no left over cooked food. \nHe sighed, “I hope I won’t burn the kitchen.” \nHe’s trying to cook himself some bulgogi, maybe the easiest?—\nBut nah, he’ll be needing to sauté garlic and onion for the meat — and he hates doing that the most. \nHe’s not yet even starting to cook, but he’s already having trouble with how to chop the ingredients. \n“God, help me.” He said and he slowly tried to chop the onion.—\nBut he couldn’t even chop it in a fine shape. \nHe laughed to himself, he thought he looked like a fool. He’s already sweating just because of this. \n“Okay, I got this! Come on Tae!” He encouraged himself.—\nHe rolled up his sleeves, tied his hair into a cute one side pigtail. He thought it was cute. \nThen, he started chopping off the onions again thinking that he was encouraged enough. \n“I think its like this...” he said, trying to remember everything about cooking.—\nThe knife was dug down the onion, and Tae sweated. “Wooh, that was tough.” \nHe gathered all his strength and focus to try and chop it off well. \n“Yes, just like this—“ \n“That’s not how you do it.” He flinched when he felt someone back-hugging him.—\nTae looked to his side, and he was very surprised to who it was. \n“Jungkook? How did you—“ \nJungkook’s chin was leaning onto Tae’s shoulder. He snaked his hand onto Tae’s and fixed his hold on the knife. \n“This is how you hold the knife.”—\nTae’s hand was under Jungkook’s hand. He starting moving his hand as he guide Tae. \n“Hold the ingredient like this, make sure you won’t cut yourself. Then slide the knife down away from you.” \nJungkook gently said. Slowly, he let Tae took over the action.—\n“L-Like this?” Tae cursed himself for stammering. But who could blame him? His heart was thumping so fast. \n“Yes, just like that.” Jungkook said, “We’re you cooking bulgogi? I can tell just by the ingredients.” \nJungkook removed his hand above Tae’s hand.—\nInstead, he wrapped it around Tae’s waist to give him a back hug. \nTae gulped, he couldn’t focus well because of what Jungkook was doing. \nIts been almost a week since the incident happened, and Jungkook was somehow doing fine now. Luckily.—\nJungkook could feel Tae tensing up. He laughed to himself because he thought it was cute. \nHe broke the hug so Tae could focus. He instead played with his hair in a pigtail. \n“How did you get in? I did not even hear you open the door.”—\n“Maybe because you’re too focused.” Jungkook said and giggled at Tae’s hair. “Your hair looks adorable.” \nTae laughed, “Thanks?” As he finished chopping the ingredients, he prepared the pan and set the fire on the stove using a lit match stick.—\nHe poured the oil and let it hear first. After that, he put the chopped ingredients onto the pan. \nHe did a huge flinch when pan reacted on the action and started making frying noises. \n“AH!” Tae hid behind the wall as he hold the pan cover as his sheild.—\nJungkook laughed, he grabbed the&nbsp; spatula and started mixing the ingredients so that it wouldn’t burn. \n“You can’t cook.” He chuckled, Tae pouted. Well, he really cant. \nIn the end, Jungkook was the one who cooked instead.—\nAnd the food was really delicious. \nAfter that, Tae washed himself to get ready to sleep. “Anyway, what brought you here?” He asked the younger who was currently lying on the bed. \n“For you.” He simply responded. \n“For me? What do you mean?”—\n“I heard you’re alone now because Bogum and his family went away. And if I don’t know you, I would actually punish you now.” \nTae awkwardly laughed and scratched his head. Because it was very forbidden to leave the country with an ongoing military training.—\n“Sorry.” Tae chuckled. \n“And I’m kinda worried that you’re alone. So I’m staying here with you for the meantime.” \nTae’s eyes bawled at what he heard. He was buffering for a minute. \n“What?” \n“I said I’ll stay here with you. Do you not want it?”—\nTae looked away as he felt the heat going up straight to his face.\n‘Does that mean he’ll sleep with me?!’ Tae panicked with this thoughts.\n“N-No, thats not what I mean. I mean its good tho but...” \nJungkook raised a brow, “But?”—\n“Wouldn’t it be dangerous? If the people see you here?” \nJungkook smiled, like he already knew it was coming. “Don’t worry, I have my ways to not get caught.” \nJungkook started pulling in his things. It wasn’t that much tho, just enough for days of staying.\n—\nAnd Tae was quite confused when he saw that Jungkook pulled in a big painting canvas. \n“What is this for?” Tae asked as he run his fingers on the textures of the canvas. “I was actually gonna ask you something...”\n“What is it?”—\nJungkook looks like he was hesitating, because what if he gets rejected?\nEven though he knew that it was just a simple request, he still didn’t like the feeling of being rejected. \nAnd its making him anxious.\n“Hey its okay, you can tell me.” Tae reassured him.—\n“Can I paint you?” \nTae went frozen for a second when Jungkook said that. “I-I mean like, will you be my husband—I mean my subject?” \nJungkook’s ears were red, and his cheeks were somehow tinted pink. He’s feeling nervous.\n“Paint me? W-Why would you want to paint me?”—\n“Because I like you—I mean love y—ah shit.” \nTae giggled at Jungkook stammering, he thought he’s cute when shy. Jungkook breathed in to focus.\n“I wanted to paint you just incase time comes, and I won’t be able to see you again.”—\n“I don’t have anything like your cellphone to save a picture for long. So I wanted to paint you instead, because I wanted to remember you. Or even if I can’t remember you anymore, I will still have something to look back on. I want to keep you in my memory forever.”—\nHis words felt different to Tae, and he hated to hear those words so much. \n“Of course, you can paint me.” He flashed a smile, and Jungkook can never be happier when Tae accepted his offer. \nAnd Tae felt excited because its the first time he’ll be modeling for a painting.—\n“Just wait here, I wanna do something for the painting.” Tae said and ran straight into the bathroom to maybe...dress up?\nWhile waiting, Jungkook prepared all his stuffs for painting. From the smudged palette, with the old brushes, it felt like nostalgia for him.—\nOut of all his busy schedule, he never got to paint for long. Maybe, just sketches, but paintings? Nah, he didn’t have time.\nBut now, he wanted to do this. Because Tae was too beautiful for him to not be in a painting.\nHe’s too good for the world.\nCge umutang na kayo para pambili ng ticket ng bts concert and bts in the soop ang tagal.ko nang army hindi pa ako nakakapunta sa concert \nWell its ok tho am still proud and forever army! \nOnce a army forever army! \nMark my words \nWe are family here \nArmy forever \nThank you guys for supporting btw vote and follow \nDamn it \nAs always \nMabuhay kayo hanggang gusto nyo!\n"},{"title":"97","data":"Ok may exam kasi kaya di ako makapag update pero dahil makuliy kayo cge lang babagsak ako sa math (10x²-50y³) yes hiral nice🙂\n—\n“Uh, Jungkook...?” Tae called, head peeking out of the bathroom door while his body was still hidden.\n“Yes?” Jungkook answered. \nTae looked down his body in hesitation. “I-I don’t think you’ll like what I wanted to do.” He said.\n“What do you mean?”—\nTae opened his mouth, but no words came out. He didn’t know if he’s doing it right or he’s just being to happy thats why the courage came out.\n“Why are you still hiding? Come here.” Jungkook encouraged.\n“But...I did something.”\n“Come out. How can I see?”—\nTae gulped, he was feeling nervous but he really wanted to do this. \nAs soon as Tae stepped out, Jungkook felt like fainting. He couldn’t even move any in his body out of astonishment. All he could feel was his heart thumping so loud.\nHe followed Tae with his eyes.—\nTae’s wearing a white long sleeved polo shirt, the length’s just 3 inches down his hips. Collars were down his shoulders, and it has like sweater paws.\nBut thats not what Jungkook is amazed for.\nCoz Tae wasn’t wearing anything under — just his bare &amp; beautifully tanned body.—\nJungkook was quietly staring for too long, and Tae felt a bit anxious. \nHe pulled cloth in between to cover himself out of embarrassment. “I-I’m sorry I’ll just change—“\nHe was about to leave when Jungkook spoke and stopped him. \n“Don’t change.”—\nThe polo was open, not buttoned. Just like a jacket but it was off his shoulders.\nJungkook felt like screaming because of amazement. “You look wonderful, don’t change.” Jungkook said, face flushed in red.\nTae slowly went to the couch, so Jungkook can start painting.—\n“H-how do you want me to pose?” Tae asked, because its usually like that. Poses are very important especially in a nude painting because it needs to convey emotions.\n“I-Its up to you, on where you feel comfortable. I’ll just fix it, if ever?”—\nJungkook was trying to avoid eye contact because he was mentally panicking. \nEven though he already saw him naked back then, it still never failed to amaze on how beautiful Taehyung was. He felt like crying.\nTae faced the side, posing his legs up like its making a triangle.—\nHe placed his arms above his knees and leaned his head onto it. “I-Is this fine?” Tae asked.\n“Uh yeah...just...hold up.” Jungkook stood up and Tae could feel his heart beating so fast.\nThe younger held his hand, “I think its b-better if you place your hand down t-there.”—\nAnd now, the legs remained on that pose. Tae’s hands were now down in between his legs and his head was leaning down his knees.\n“Like this?” Tae asked and Jungkook nodded. \nBefore going back to his seat, Jungkook tucked Tae’s hair behind his ear cuz its covering his face.—\n“Perfect.” \nJungkook went back, sitting down in front of an empty canvas while Tae was a bit far behind it. \nJungkook couldn’t actually focus because everytime he looks to draw him, Tae was looking at him too. And he’s fucking beautiful.—\n“What’s wrong with your ear Captain?” \nTae asked, as he remained still on his pose. “Why is it red?” Tae teased, because he thought Jungkook was cute. \nJungkook chuckled a bit. “If you keep doing that I might lose my shit like before.” \nTae was shut. Oh shit.—\nWithin just a few minutes, the sketch was done. And Jungkook had started painting.\nMixing all the possible colors, he started putting the base and shades. \n“Hyung...” Jungkook called as he looked at the elder for the reference.\n“Hm?” Tae hummed.—\n“Thank you.” Jungkook muttered, eyes a bit glistening. And Tae felt a bit confused. \n“For what?” He asked, looking at Jungkook as he examine his features.\n“For trusting me with your body.” Jungkook flashed a sincere smile at the elder.—\n“I know its hard to get that courage. But I’m just really touched that you trusted me with yourself, your body, soul and everything. And I assure you that your trust won’t go to waste.” \nTae smiled at his words. His eyes tearing up a little because he did not expect those.<br>—\n“I love you.” \nJungkook felt deaf because his heart was beating too loud. He was so surprised and happy because it was really out of nowhere.\nIt was just those three simple words — but it meant a lot to him.\n“I love you more.” Jungkook responded with a smile.—\nAfter a few hours, the painting was finished. “Its done.” Jungkook said proudly.\n“Can I see?” Tae excitedly said as he quickly got up from the couch. Feeling a bit numb because he posed still for too long.\nHe saw the painting, and his smile dropped.—\nJungkook’s heart broke when he saw his reaction. “W-Why? Do you not like it?” He asked nervously.\nTae gently held the painting and looked at it once again. “Are you kidding me?”\nHe asked, Jungkook felt anxious.\n“This is too beautiful! There’s no way you’re a human!”—\nJungkook let out a breathe of relief. “Jungkook...I’m not this beautiful.” Tae said while looking at the painting.\nJungkook raised a brow, feeling a bit pissed of what Tae said.\n“What did you say?” Jungkook clicked his tongue, and his expression changed.—\nTae felt a bit intimidated. \n“I-I’m not this beautiful...you drew me t—“ \nJungkook snatched the canvas from him hand and placed it on the side. Tae was surprised when Jungkook carried him and threw him onto the bed.\n“What are—“\n“You said ur not that beautiful, right?”—\nJungkook was on top of him, practically placing his arms on his side so he’s locking him.\n“Ye—“\n“Then I’ll show you how beautiful you are.” \nAnd again, the rest of the nigt,\nwas indeed history.\nCge ok na update ako uli kapag may time ako \nMabuhay kayo hanggang gusto nyo!\n"},{"title":"98","data":"378.\nTaehyung turned to the side, trying to feel if Jungkook was still beside him on the bed,\nAnd he opened his eyes in fear when he felt that no one was there — and Jungkook was not on his side.\nHe sat bolt upright, thoughts running in his mind as he looked out the window.—\nIt’s still dark, coz it’s just 4 in the morning. His body clock has set to this time coz he got used to it. Back then, he usually wakes up at 10 in morning whenever he didn’t have school.\nBut that shouldn’t be the topic now coz what if...\nWhat if something happened again?—\n“Jungkook?” Tae called.\nBut only silence replied to him.\nHis heart was beating so fast out of fear. He’s overthinking again, but he couldn’t help himself. He’s had enough of what happened back then and he didn’t want it to repeat again.\n“Jungkook?” Still no answer.—\nHe quickly got down the bed, legs a but wobbly cuz you know, last night was amazing. \n“Jungkook?” He called again as soon as he got out from the bedroom. He went to the kitchen, and he only saw that a food was prepared there. \n“Fuck, please no.”—\nHe felt like crying cuz its just like deja vu. This felt familiar and he didn’t like the sound of it. \n“Jungkook? Are you here?”\nHe heard footsteps outside, he turned around to face the front door because he was back facing it.—\n“Hyung we’re you looking for m—oh...wow...”\nJungkook stopped in his tracks, holding a basket, eyes traveled on Tae’s body.\n“U didn’t tell me u wanted another round?”\nTae’s brows furrowed. “Huh?—oh shit.” He quickly covered himself because he fucking forgot that he’s naked.—\n“NO THATS NOT WHAT I MEAN!” Tae cried and ran back into the bedroom. \nJungkook laughed at his cuteness. Oh god, he’ll never get tired of him.\nHe stepped inside the house and placed the basket on the table. He rinsed the fruit with water as he heard a door open.—\nTae came out with finally clothes on, he’s cursing himself for being so dumb. \n“Where did you go? I was worried for awhile.” Tae said as he sat on the chair table. \n“I was just in the backyard to pick some strawberries. Aren’t they your favorite?”—\nTae’s eyes lit up when he heard the word ‘strawberries’. “Yes! I love them so much, oh god its not even funny.” \nHe quickly ran to Jungkook to check the strawberries in the basket. His heart jumped when he saw how many they are.—\nTae picked a strawberry from the basket and was about to put it in his mouth when Jungkook held his wrist to stop him.\n“Nuh-uh, that’s not yet rinsed. And you should eat the breakfast I served before you eat strawberries.” \nHe snatched the fruit from his hand.—\nTae pouted, “That’s unfair!” \nJungkook placed all the rinsed strawberries on the side then gave a look at Tae. \n“That’s not unfair. If you eat this first do you think you’ll still want to eat the food I made? No, this is an order from—“\n“—From your Captain. I get it.”—\n“Wrong.” Tae was confused when he said that. \n“Then from what?”\nJungkook placed a quick kiss on Tae’s nose. “Your boyfriend.”\nTae’s frozen, he didn’t actually expect that. “I’ll just take change clothes, you should already be eating once I come out.”<br>[ TIME SKIP : IN THE CAMP ]—\nTae and Jungkook went to the camp separately — Jungkook went in first because he’s usually really early. \nAnd now Tae had just arrived in the camp, and he felt a bit sad since he knew that Bogum isn’t here anymore.\nHe sighed, “He’s safer there. I don’t have to worry.”—\nBut then change POVs, lets switch to Jungkook.\nWho was overly angry about what the Major was commanding him. “Sir we cannot send the trainees to the—“\n“What do you mean we can’t? Do you not understand the situation here Captain?!”—\n“Sir as you said they’re still trainees! They haven’t even graduated &amp; you want me to send them to a war?—“\nMajor Chan pulled him by his collars. \n“I DON’T FUCKING CARE! Aren’t they trained for that?! A lot of people will die if we don’t send them, dO YOU UNDERSTAND?!”<br>—\n“You are just a Captain! You don’t have the position to disobey me! Now get those fuckers ready and you’re sending them to the other city by next week!”\nThe Major shut the door loud as he left. \nJungkook clicked his tongue, it was just morning and he’s feeling so stressed.—\nHe felt so angry, so so angry that he wanted to throw all the things around him. \nBut he had to control himself. “We’re left with no choice, aren’t we sir?” Lieutenant Kang asked, also feeling frustrated.\n“What else? This is so fucked up.”—\n“But what do we do now? We haven’t trained them in an actual war yet. What if it goes wrong?” He asked.\nJungkook sighed, thinking about the possibilities. If only those Americans did not come...bullshit.\n“Gather them around, we need to set them for the war.”<br>379. \nAs the usual, Tae and Jungkook met on their place — everynight on trainings under that one specific tree — who witnessed their love for each other.\nAnd Tae came, seeing Jungkook holding his guitar and plucking some strings, with a notebook on the side.—\n“Woah, you play guitar?” \nJungkook flinched in surprise, he did not notice that Tae was already there. He quickly closed the notebook and hid it behind him. “Uh, not much. Just stressing out.” He said.\nTae sat beside him, admiring those beautiful fingers on the strings.—\n“Yeah, you look kinda stressed. Did something happen?” Tae asked, examining the younger before him, who looks so troubled.\n“Is it about the war? You announced earlier?” He asked, and Jungkook nodded with a sigh. \n“Some foreigners had a deal &amp; it became a war. Now we’ll be—“—\n“—needing to go there to stop them, even if it means death.” Jungkook sounds frustrated. “I did not agree to Major’s plan but I have no choice.” \nHe plucked the strings out of frustration, it made a beautiful sound. Tae didn’t know what to say.\nBut he wanted to cheer him up.—\n“Can you sing for me?” Tae asked, and Jungkook looked up with confusion. “Sing?” \nTae nodded his head with enthusiasm. “Yes! Anything! I just really want to hear you sing.” \nJungkook hesitated, “I haven’t sung for a long time so I don’t know if my voice still sound good.”—\n“Of course it does! Come on!” Tae encouraged. \nJungkook thought of a random song, but there’s only one song that was stuck in his mind. And even if he just heard it once, he can remember every single words and even the instrumental.\n“Loving can hurt~...”—\nTae was surprised, as Jungkook played the right chords, and even the right strings on the song. \n“We keep this love in a photograph, we made this memories for ourselves, where our eyes are never closing, hearts were never broken, times forever frozen still~...”—\n“So you can keep me~...”\nJungkook looked up as he heard Tae was singing along. “Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans, holding me closer till our eyes meet, you won’t ever be alone~...”\nTheir voices blend like how the moon and sun collide during a lunar and solar eclipse.—\nIts sounds more than the beauty that the heavens can make.\n“And if you hurt me, its okay baby only words bleed, inside this pages you just hold me, I won’t ever let you down~...”\nHearts out while singing, nothing could ever be more beautiful than hearing melodies.—\n“Wait for me to come home~...”\nJungkook made the last strum on the strings to end the song, and Tae giggled as he clapped. “Wow! You remembered the song?” He asked.\n“It’s really beautiful, maybe thats why its stuck in my mind.” Jungkook said.—\nThe younger stood up, and grabbed a stone — not much big, but just average — it was a bit sharp tho. \n“What’s that for?” Tae asked as he watched Jungkook scratch the trunk of the tree with the stone. \n“Hey! That’s not good for the tree, don’t do that.”—\nTae stood up and held Jungkook’s wrist to stop him. “Is it?” The younger asked and Tae nodded.\nJungkook looked back at the tree, and looked back at Tae with those puppy eyes. “But this tree fulfills everything.” \nTae was confused. “What do you mean?”—\nJungkook stepped back, and jumped up to reach the branches, then he didst divided it so that the light of the moon can reach the trunk.\n“Do you see the names?” Jungkook said as he went back and pointed at the names engraved on the trunk. \n“Why haven’t I seen this before?”—\n“People tend to scrape their names here, and they said those couples who did, ended up together. Look at this names.” Jungkook pointed on two specific names.\nTae furrowed as he tried to read it. “Rose love...Hyun?”\nJungkook smiled, “Yes. They’re my parents.”—\n“Some couples that I know wrote their names here and they ended up together. Why don’t we try?” Jungkook said.\nHe eagerly dug the stone onto the trunk and started engraving some letters. \nTae changed his mind and grabbed a stone. “Me too, me too!”—\nWith a little twist and turns, they finally finished it.\n“Taehyung love Jungkook. Sounds cute to me.” Jungkook said and they both laughed.<br>[ TIME SKIP BECAUSE IM EXCITED ] 😭😭\n—\n“WHO THE FUCK DID IT?!” \nEarly in the morning, they’re not even fully awake yet, but all of the trainees are standing in the field looking so clueless as they listen to an angry Jungkook.\n“WHO THE FUCK STOLE HALF OF THE WAR EQUIPMENTS LAST NIGHT?!”—\nTae couldn’t even open his eyes properly yet because he just woke up. And yet here’s Jungkook shouting with all his anger.\n“WHO THE FUCK DID?!” \nJungkook was so angry that his veins are showing up, and his voice is sounding like thunder.—\n“No one is gonna answer?” The Captain asked, and the trainees felt so nervous. \nThey’ve seen Jungkook angry, but not as angry as this. \nThe Captain pulled his gun from his pocket and pulled the trigger. The bullets hitting the ground as it created loud sounds.—\nEveryone was surprised, and got really afraid because of what Jungkook did. “Sir, please put down your gun.” \nLieutenant Kang said, and Jungkook angrily placed back his gun onto his pocket. \n“WHO THE FUCK HAD THE BALLS TO STEAL GUNS FROM HIS OWN CAMP?!”—\n“ANSWER ME MOTHERFUCKERS!” \nEveryone flinched at his thunderous voice. Even Tae felt scared at his duality. Just last night, he saw his beautiful puppy eyes. And now, his eyes suddenly turned so sharp like a dragon’s.\n“Sir, I’m sorry but I have no clue about what happened.”—\nA trainee spoke, expecting that Jungkook would finally calm down if someone answered him. \n“Sir, I checked the storage room last night before I sleep. It was still there.” Another trainee said.\nJungkook smirked out of annoyance, then rolled his eyes.—\n“It was so dumb of me to ask you all of who stole it. I forgot that criminals never admit their crimes.” \nJungkook looked each and one of them, examining their looks and expressions. “To the person who stole it,”\n“Make sure I won’t find out who you are.”—\n“Because if I did,”\nJungkook paused, once again traveling his eyes onto each and every person around. \n“I’ll make sure to show no mercy.”—\nBut even before Jungkook could leave, Sergeant Han came running with a piece of paper on his hand.\n“Sir! I found something in the storage room. I really think you need to see this.” \nJungkook furrowed as he looked at the paper that’s given to him.\nOk na po ba ok see you bye na \nAs always \nMabuhay kayo hanggang gusto nyo!\n"},{"title":"99","data":"Hi guys thank you for supporting this, and as you all know this story is not mine i just saw this on twitter i did not expect that a lot of you guys will support 19.6k reads and 931 votes 😭😭😭😭 am so thankful even this story is not mine am still hoping if i write my story a lot of you will still support am thinking after this 1894 ill write a story am not sure if its taekook or not but am still hoping i could do well haha i font have a confidence haha btw am just so happy thank you guys 😍\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/810115e59f4f728c430684b0caa3978d0a26ef7d/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f3938784d756b6b456532566762773d3d2d3132312e313661616337313138626163663465373531313935343037353635332e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"655\" data-original-height=\"374\" alt=\"6k reads and 931 votes 😭😭😭😭 am so thankful even this story is not mine am still hoping if i write my story a lot of you will still support am thinking after this 1894 ill write a story am not sure if its taekook or not but am still hoping i co...\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \nOK cge na eto na \n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/bd009c0ba678561db147b1b631c300ef7eae09a0/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f5535716b6a7735496253583941513d3d2d3132312e313661616337333766373765616162643739373931373336323836382e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"1920\" data-original-height=\"1483\" alt=\"OK cge na eto na \">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n—\n“Its a code. But I think that’s a clue on who the culprit is.”\nJungkook calculated everything in his head, and within just a split second, he cracked the code.\nThe crumpled the paper in his hand out of anger.\nHe knew who it was.380. \nAs he arrived at Hugo’s office, Jungkook immediately threw him the crumpled paper instead of greeting him. \n“What the—excuse me?” Hugo asked, feeling so confused at Jungkook. \nHe stood there, examining his expressions. \n“Tell me what you know.”—\nCaptain Hugo raised a brow, unable to understand what Jungkook meant. “Pardon?” \n“Open the damn paper.” Jungkook ordered, and Hugo did open the crumpled paper. \nHe furrowed his brows while deciphering the code. \n“He’s a Captain? What does this meant?”—\nJungkook folded his arms as he speak. \n“That paper was found in the storage room where all the equipments were. We checked the the room this morning, and half of the equipments were gone. I’m suspecting that it’s a clue.” \nHugo laughed, feeling offended.—\n“Are you suspecting that I was the one who stole the equipments?” \nJungkook shook. \n“Maybe, a normal person would do. But I don’t consider myself a normal person.” He paused, connecting everything in his mind. \nHugo raised a brow in confusion.—\n“If you’re really the culprit, then why would you put a clue that can lure you out?” Jungkook asked. \nHugo’s eyes narrowed. “I believe that you’re not the one who stole it. But I know that YOU KNOW something.” \nHugo clicked his tongue. “That just means you still suspect me.”—\nJungkook went forward, placing his hands onto the table. \n“And If I am?”\nHugo glared at him, feeling a bit pissed on his fellow’s attitude. \n“Look, whatever you’re talking about, I know nothing. So if you’ll excuse me—“\n“Do you think I’m that dumb to believe you?”—\nHugo stood up in annoyance, “What the hell is your problem? Can you not mind your own bu—“\n“For your fucking information we’re on the same business so If you tell me to mind mine, then It’s basically yours too.” \nHugo did not speak, but fought Jungkook with eyes.—\nHugo sighed, trying to calm himself because he didn’t want to start anything. \n“Captain, if you don’t trust your fellow then you could’ve just reported me and send me to another camp. And we’re on the same level, so don’t fucking—“ \nJungkook grabbed his collar.—\nHis fist was shaking in anger. “The audacity of you to say that we’re on the same level.” \nAnd with that, Hugo had enough. \nHe held Jungkook’s hand and swung a fist onto his face. Jungkook almost stumbled, only a blood on his lips. \n“You’re getting on my nerves!”—\nJungkook wiped the blood on his lips and glared at Hugo. “Don’t worry, I’ve had enough of your acting too.” \nWithin a split second, Hugo was surprised because Jungkook’s speed isn’t really a joke. \nJungkook punched him square in the face, making him stumble on the floor.—\n“Do you think I don’t know that your father is the General of the Army? The motherfucking person who set everything up?” \nHugo got blood down his nose, he glared at Jungkook as he try to stand up. \nBut even before he could, Jungkook had thrown him another fist.—\nHe was thrown onto the other side of the room, hitting the wall. \n“Do you think I don’t know that you’re asked by your father to watch every single move we do? DO YOU THINK I’M DUMB TO NOT NOTICE THAT?!” \nJungkook’s voice was thunder, bur both flinched at the sound.—\nBecause outside the room, a loud explosion was heard just from meters away. \nIt was very loud that Jungkook knew it was inside the camp.\nLoud fuss and screams were heard outside, and he can see the trainees coming out of their rooms for safety.—\nJungkook cursed under his breath, the events adding more fuel to his burning anger. \nHe went out, and saw that just meters away, a part of the camp building collapsed. It was 4 floors, and it made a lot of damage as the blocks fell down.—\n“What’s happening?” Jungkook asked Sergeant Min on the side who was busy guiding the trainees. \n“A bomb was planted on the 2nd floor of that building. It exploded and unfortunately, the trainees staying there were probably dead by now.”—\nEveryone was going out of their rooms, the staffs giving them some equipments just incase something comes. \nJungkook felt so scared, so scared that he felt like dying in any moment. \nBecause that part of the building, is where Tae’s room is.<br>—\nHe immediately explored his gaze around to try and look for Taehyung. \nBut he did not find him. \nHis heart was beating so fast, he didn’t want to think at all because he didn’t want to jump into conclusions. \nBut his anxiety is kicking in and he hated it.—\nIt was a mess, the trainees were on their gears, all of them have got out now. \nBut Jungkook couldn’t accept the fact that he couldn’t find Tae anywhere. \nStill tinted with fear, but they needed to gather themselves together. \nBecause they are soldiers.—\n“Is everyone okay? Anyone hurt?” Even if he’s still in shock and fear, Jungkook needed to stand up even just for his people. \nSome were wounded, some were severely injured. \nDoctor Jung spoke. “We’ll treat the severely injured first!” He shouted.—\nBut even before Doctor Jung could move with his fellow military doctors, he fell on the ground as a loud gunshot was made. \nBlood coming out from his head, and Jungkook could never be more unprepared. \n“What the fuck.”—\nHe cursed as he spotted some other soldiers from afar, and he can confirm that they’re not from each of them. \nBut from America. \n“Everyone hold your guns, we’re under attack!” Jungkook shouted, and everyone gathered themselves.—\nMore and more opponents were showing up from the other side. \nFrom one gunshot, to two, until they’re already exchanging bullets. The camp was filled with gunshots and screams. \nLandmines were planted and some had stepped on it so it exploded.—\nJungkook had shot some opponents, but he couldn’t focus enough because Tae was flooding his mind. \nHe decided to make his way into the fallen building, trying to avoid all the shots and dangers. \nBecause his heart would never calm down if he did not confirm that Tae’s safe.—\nHe knew this was planned, because the landmines are already planted, and they really even stole half of the guns and protection to make sure that they win. \nBut even before he could step inside the building, he was blocked by another soldier, an opponent.—\nJungkook grabbed his katana from his back, and pointed it towards the soldier. \nHe held onto his gun, just incase he needed to pull it out quick. “Who sent all of you here?” \nBut the soldier just smirked at him. “Don’t fight back anymore, you’ll soon be under our rule.”—\nThe soldier pulled the trigger, but Jungkook was thankful that he’s sharp because he had blocked the bullet with his katana, and it flew onto the other direction. \nThe soldier was surprised, but quite amazed. “Not bad for a Captain like you,”—\nJungkook had kicked the gun out of his hand, and now he’s empty handed. \nBut he thought, that the guy was good at martial arts. “Drop the sword asshole, fight me with your hands.” \nHe said as he did a starting pose on taekwondo.—\nJungkook placed back his katana. He knew how to fight fairly. “You tested me.” \nA high kick was made in the air, it almost hit Jungkook but he was fast enough to block it. He turned to the side and tried to aim a punch in his face. \nBut the other one was really good at this.—\nJungkook flew a kick but he was surprised when the other soldier held his leg and flipped him, then threw him on the ground. \nThe impact was very hard that Jungkook had a scratch on his face for hitting the ground. \nWhen he turned around, the other was holding his gun now.<br>—\n“You could’ve just surrendered, Captain.” \nThe soldier pointed the gun at him, walking backwards to get a better view of an awful person. He smirked. \n“Stop acting like a hero,” \nHe keep stepping back, that he’s almost reaching the grass ground outside.—\nJungkook stood quiet, observing his surroundings. And he saw something from behind the soldier, that somehow gave him hope. \n“You will never be a hero.” The soldier stopped stepping back, and Jungkook somehow felt disappointed. \n“I guess this is your goodbye.”—\n“Wait,” Jungkook spoke, looking at him straight in the eye. \n“Before you kill me, why not take another step backward? So you will have a better view of me dying.” Jungkook offered. \nAnd the soldier smirked, “How eager of you to die.” He laughed.—\nThe soldier took a step backward and smiled at him with evil. \nHe placed his finger on the trigger, ready to pull it. “Have a nice journey to hell.” \nJungkook didn’t know if his plan will work, but he hoped it will. He smiled back, \n“Same goes to you.”—\nBut even before the soldier could react, as he took another step backward, he knew it was his end. \nBecause he didn’t even noticed that he stepped on a landmine. \nAs he lift his foot, Jungkook readied himself to run. \nAnd a loud explosion was heard.—\nWith the huge force, Jungkook was thrown on the floor. The sparks and bits of the fire were scattered on the floor, but luckily it wasn’t enough to set the building on fire. \nEven if his body still hurts, he gathered himself to get up. \nHe needs to find Taehyung.—\nHe tried to remember the room number that Tae was in. \n091. \nHe quickly went to that room and he couldn’t feel more weight in his heart when he saw that it was destroyed. \nInside were a few soldiers lying down with their blood, \nthey’re all dead.—\nHe tried to look for Namjoon and Seokjin in the bodies, because as far as he knew they were Tae’s close friends. \nAnd he somehow felt happy when he saw that they were not one in the dead bodies. \nThere was this one person under a huge crack of stone.—\nHe was crying in pain because the big rock was burying him, and there was a sharp rock stabbed in his leg. \nJungkook quickly ran to them, and lifted the heavy rock. The heaviness wasn’t a joke actually.—\n“Taehyung?!” Jungkook cried, he quickly knelt down and held Tae in his arms. \nHe had a scar on his face, some wounds on his arm. But that’s not what he’s crying for. \nIt was because of that sharp stone stabbed on his leg. \n“Its hurts...so bad..” Tae cried.—\nHe groaned in pain, tears not stopping from coming down. \nJungkook felt so angry, but at the same time he was so worried. He thought of a solution to reduce his pain. \n“Hyung, I need you to breathe in and out, then count one to three.” He ordered.—\nTae’s breath was shaky, and it looks like he’s having troubles in breathing. \n“Why? I can’t even think well!” He groaned, lying on Jungkook’s lap as he cry over the stab. \n“Just do it okay? Trust me.” Jungkook knew it will hurt, but he had to do this.—\nTae breathed in and out, he didn’t know what he’s gonna do but he counted one to three. \n“O-one...two..—AH!” \nHe let out a loud groan when Jungkook suddenly pulled out the stone from his leg. \n“WHAT THE FUCK?!” Tae cried and smacked Jungkook’s chest. It hurts so bad.—\nTae’s breath was even more shaky now, the pain from his leg was throbbing and this is the most painful thing that he felt physically. \n“I’m sorry, It would be worse if I don’t pull it out.” \nTae was holding tightly onto Jungkook’s sleeves out of pain.—\nJungkook spotted a scarf from beside him and grabbed it. He tied it around Tae’s leg so the bleeding would be reduced. \nHis heart was beating so hard that he felt like crying. He gently hugged Tae who was crying so hard. \n“I thought I lost you. I was so worried.”—\n“I-I thought I was g-gonna die...” Tae said in between his cries, still frustrated over the stab. \n“Jungkook I saw it in m-my dream...” Tae muttered, forcing some words out of him. \nJungkook was so confused. “Dream?” He asked.—\nTae nodded and gasped for air, he’s having panic attacks. \n“I saw it. I-I saw everything in my dream. I’m scared I’m s-so so scared...” \nHis grip was tightening on Jungkook sleeves and Jungkook felt nervous. \n“Calm down okay? I’m here, you can tell me.”—\n“Its...starting...” \nTae spoke, managing himself to speak in between sobs. His head was aching and he felt dizzy. \n“The w-world war...its starting.” \nThose were his last words before Tae lost consciousness.\nOk 😭😭 thank you so much to u guys \nGinanahan ako 😭\nAs always\nMabuhay kayo hanggang gusto nyo! \n"},{"title":"100","data":"381. \n\"Agh...\" \nTae opened his eyes, he just woke up and yet he's already welcomed by pain. \nHe held onto his injured leg, it was aching. But it was already bandaged.\nHe looked around to see that he was inside a tent - a fabric tent to be specific.\n\"Captain! He's awake!\"-\nHe saw a soldier peek inside, and voices were all over. \nAs soon as Jungkook heard that, he came within the speed of thunder. Probably thanking the heavens that Tae had finally woke.\nHe went inside, and knelt down beside him, looking at Tae with worry in his eyes.-\n\"How are you feeling?\" Jungkook gently asked. \nHe wanted to hold him, hug him, and give him kisses out of worry, but he cant. Because lots of trainees and soldiers are looking. \n\"I-I'm quite better than earlier.\" Tae said, voice still weak.-\nLieutenant Min came in, examining Tae's being. He has so many questions to ask, but he needs to hold himself. \n\"If its okay, can you tell us what exactly happened?\" He paused. \n\"You're the only one who survived the explosion, considering that you're near the bomb.\"-\nHe was right. And Tae was thankful that he only got an injury, not loss of life. \n\"I actually saw the bomb before it exploded.\" Tae started, trying to remember everything. \n\"I told everyone in the room and they started running out, but it was too late for me to save myself.\"-\n\"The bomb already exploded, and the next thing I knew was something pierced my leg and I hit the wall, then lost consciousness.\"\nLieutenant nodded, \"That's better than nothing.\" He stood up and left. \nEveryone left infront of the tent but Jungkook stayed.-\nHe closed the opening of the tent for privacy. \nHe held Tae's hand to give him comfort, and to distract him from the pain. \n\"Was there any other reason why you didn't get out in time?\" He asked, since he was quite suspicious about it. \nTae looks troubled.-\n\"I...\" he started, \"I don't know how to explain it. But...\" \nJungkook placed a kiss on Tae's knuckles, telling him that it's okay. \n\"The other Tae was trying to control me.\" \nJungkook paused at his words, not being able to sink it in.-\n\"I had a very painful headache as soon as I was about to go out. I couldn't move my body out of pain and just crouched. I think he's trying to k!ll me now.\" \nThe younger didn't know how to react. \"He can control you?\" Tae nodded. \n\"If he can, then you can control him too!\"-\nOh how he wish he could. \"But I don't know how. All I can do for now is fight back everything he's giving me.\" \nThey're currently inside a forest, a wide forest. Because they're now unsafe in the camp. And this is the most remote place. \nThey built camps for their shelters.-\nNone of them knows what might happen next. They haven't even reached the capital, but they know that its a lot of mess there. \nThey just hoped, that it will end soon. \nThat this world war will end soon.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/39d9fb8c1338b44f208b9dc27043a4cb63c3ecac/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f30656248485a596c4971307468773d3d2d3132322e313661623465663034633739323638303132353636313636303231392e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"1294\" alt=\"That this world war will end soon\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/eb3eb0503a5f09cf27cb3666c4257ddc1b44128e/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f47784742484b33746c57692d52773d3d2d3132322e313661623465663065663936353138393131313234393031393238312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"1294\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/971746160089844e7c08ab809fbd764646ad827e/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f563977775a3278736a385a6665413d3d2d3132322e313661623465663138353238373436653734363832373831353337392e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"1294\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/c4bc018edb9afb9866d593f8e9026e3375d5689a/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f6a6532666c6d65357677396544513d3d2d3132322e313661623465663166653665616363303132353434383735323238322e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"1294\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/0d1c6d79881489e1adb925897d5d3167ed463044/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f754a58382d595448574b735a66773d3d2d3132322e313661623465663237343230376266633630363235333031373630332e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"876\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n<br>[ CHANGE POVS : JAEWON AND THE MFS ]384. \n\"There's nothing we could do anymore but go with the flow. Besides, they already know our plan. And if we can't control them in a fair way, then let's do it brutally.\" \nReiner said, laughing with all his soldiers. They thought it was fun to play with the people.-\n\"Report,\" He ordered, sitting on the chair while smoking. \n\"The 7th camp we're Captain Jeon was in was destroyed. A lot of trainees died and they left the place.\" \nJaewon chuckled, feeling so entertained. \"They left? What a coward?\"-\nEveryone in their room laughed. \n\"The whole people of Korea were panicking right now because of the ambushes. Lots of people were killed and some were kidnapped, mostly children and women.\" The soldier explained. \n\"What's the government doing?\"-\n\"There's no news yet. But as far as I know, the president was missing &amp; some high profile politicians too. So basically, the government can't protect the people anymore.\" \nJaewon stood up, like he's boasting something. \"Y'all hear that? I can literally be the president now.\"-\nReiner smirked, feeling so satisfied at everything. \n\"Gather all the Korean soldiers that are willing to surrender. Kill those who won't. And I want you to find where that Captain Jeon and his people are staying right now.\" \nThe soldier saluted, \"Sir, yes sir!\"-\nSuddenly, the door open and spit out the two soldiers who's holding a man. \nThey threw him in front of their General. \n\"Sir, we found him eavesdropping behind the walls. By his things, I'm suspecting that he's a historian.\"-\nReiner threw the lit cigarette on the historian's hand, and it burnt his skin. \n\"Agh!\" He groaned in pain. \nReiner stood up and rummaged in the person's bag. There are lots of notebooks, a pen, and some maps. \nHe opened a notebook and saw everything that he wrote.-\n\"You have good ears huh? You heard everything that we planned?\" Reiner said as he close the notebook. \nThe historian felt so afraid, that he considered surrendering and be one of them for his life. \nHe bowed down to the floor, \"I-I'm sorry sir! Please d-don't kill me!\"-\nReiner smiled at him. \"Of course, I won't kill you.\"\nThe historian slowly got raised his head up, feeling quite happy. \"R-Really sir? Thank you! Tha-\" \nJaewon shot the guy from behind, and he fell on the floor, dead. \n\"I won't kill you, but another person will.\"-\nThe two soldiers dragged the dead body out, leaving the trace of blood. \nBut Reiner saw the bag, that was full of stories about everything that happened.-\n\"Burn his things, make sure the notebooks would be in pieces so that no one can read his writings.\" \nHe sat on the chair, and Jaewon spoke. \n\"If you're caring about your image in the history, isn't that guy just one of the historians? There's so many more.\"-\nAnd Reiner knew that he has a point. \n\"All of you!\" He called out to his soldiers. \n\"I want all of you to find and kill all historians.

As much as possible, don't make any noise.\"-\nJungkook caught Tae looking at him from his tent, and his heart ached knowing that Tae must've felt d3pressed of his situation. \nTae couldn't speak it out loud, but Jungkook was glad that he could read eyes.\nHe nodded, giving Tae an assurance that he'll be careful.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/1400f2638386da24cf0a9ef193296cf5b20495c6/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f7870633172554d585f366c444c513d3d2d3132322e313661623466326465346630626463303537333331353637353431362e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"He nodded, giving Tae an assurance that he'll be careful\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/8c13dfd949510f1303ea6ad15a6f8ce22baf576d/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f4a7246386430503941346e5250513d3d2d3132322e313661623466326533626133366337303836383132363332333238352e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/99791f8a47ac8f11c816d315a9d96e56770154c7/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f416e356a476364435370736d51513d3d2d3132322e313661623466326563633739343034373235323534313832353533352e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"494\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/343dc8d6120af2dfdbf3514c51e4d4f458f14420/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f54326b74765a6e5836704c6e52413d3d2d3132322e313661623466326635336164626264643639393832313332313432392e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"494\" alt=\"Ok na toh next na uli kayo mag intay \">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \nOk na toh next na uli kayo mag intay \nMalapit na!\nWhat will happend next?\nMy gosh\nOk as always \nMabuhay kayo hanggang gusto nyo!<br><br>\n"},{"title":"101","data":"389. \nAs he couldn’t do anything, Tae spent his time thinking of what the fairy meant about the clue. \nHe’s smart, but its just unfortunate that his brain isn’t working properly right now. \nHe looked into his bag, trying to look for something he can entertain himself with.—\nIt was all familiar things, but then his hand held some paper thingy that was inside the pocket of his bag. \nHe doesn’t remember putting anything there. \nHe quickly pulled out the paper, and it looks like it was placed there for a long time ago already.—\nIt was folded neatly, like it was actually planned. \nHe didn’t like the nervousness he’s feeling in his heart right now.

I created stains that no one would know how much emotions were stuck in there. \n“Mom...I miss you so much...” he muttered under his breath. \nOh how he wish he could still feel the warmth of her hug right now.—\nHe held the letter close to his heart as he cry everything out. \nEveryones safest place, comfort zone, and resting ground would always be the love of a mother. \nAnd it was very unfortunate that Tae lost the same mother twice. \nHow cruel of fate.—\nLegs pressed near his chest, he leaned his head above it. \n“I’ll make sure to give you justice mom, and I’ll also make sure that its worth saving me.” \nHe spoke as tears fell, “I hope you know that I’m glad that ur my mother too.”\n[ TIME SKIP BECAUSE IM EXCITED ]\n392. \nSun down from the horizon, it was around 11 in the evening. \nTae was already sleeping — well, everyone was already sleeping in their tents. \nSome soldiers were awake to guard their territory, its like changing shifts.—\nThe light of the moon shone in Tae’s face, and he was woken up. \nHe knew that the tent front opened, and it now closed cuz the light disappeared. \nBut he felt presence lying from behind him, and arms encircling on his waist like its hugging him.—\nTae felt odd, he opened his eyes and tried to feel everything behind him. \n“Jungkook?” He called, he’s backfacing the person so he didn’t know if its actually him. \n“Sorry, did I wake you up?” By the voice, he knew its him.\nTae closed his eyes back, feeling secure now.—\n“Hmm, its okay.” Tae answered, “What brought you here? Did something happened?” \nHe felt Jungkook’s embrace getting tighter, but still enough to give him comfort. \n“Nothing, I can’t help but overthink. And I can’t sleep, so I came here.”—\n“How does that connect?” \n“Your my safe place.” \nTae smiled at his words, his heart jumped to be honest. “What we’re you thinking?” He asked. \n“A lot, so much. And you’re one of them.” \nTae turned to face him, “Are you flirting with me, sir?”—\nJungkook laughed, “Maybe.” \nTae pinched his nipples and Jungkook groaned as he laugh. “This isn’t the right time for that.” He chuckled. \n“Sorry, I was trying to stress out. My mind is really a mess right now. I’m scared.”—\nTae felt sad. \nBecause of course, as a Captain, everyone had so much faith an trust in you. He couldn’t imagine all the pressure that Jungkook is feeling right now. \n“And that Hugo, he’s up to something. I don’t think we can trust him.”—\n“I want to move everyone in the capital, but its a lot messy there. The people are being enslaved, lots of murders are happening. Fuck, I know they’ll find us soon.” \nThe worry was evident in Jungkook’s face. \nI mean, its one of the reasons why I hate being a leader.—\nJungkook was so lost in thoughts that he didn’t realize that Tae was staring at him. \nWith all the love in his eyes, Tae admired his features. He thought his eyes were so beautiful as it hit the light of the moon.—\n“The universe must’ve adored you so much...” Tae started, and Jungkook looked up to him. \n“Why?” \n“Because it placed all the stars in your eyes.”—\nJungkook was flustered that he looked down to hide his eyes. \nOh how he wish they’ll last like this, how he wish the peace will be much longer. \nBecause at this moment, he’s not sure if they’ll even survive tomorrow.—\n“Can I sleep here?” Jungkook asked, pleading with his eyes. \nAnd how can Tae say ‘no’ from those puppy eyes? “What else? You know i’d say ‘yes’ now idiot.” \nAnd the night ended like that. \nBut the next day wasn’t quite merciful.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/e1c1dcc9c6bfaa26b5fd7f062b78050537ed03cd/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f53706b6c5444594d45366c7432673d3d2d3132332e313661623466386138653434326461353530363136343934353639392e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\"But the next day wasn’t quite merciful\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/560c41389d8f67f822da58c5bb1454109713b708/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f6a4739756b683246597356394f773d3d2d3132332e313661623466386164643366373262343236323531383636363939392e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/4ac23f7776772d178b9ab950c4890511a91a68d0/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f4a677a72566550527765494a5f413d3d2d3132332e313661623466386236386335656537343132383935363434303732352e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"494\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/02328193a3749f8669e9fb94f9470420b4d6e32a/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f61456d4c542d39554c316a7953773d3d2d3132332e313661623466386265306263376363623835323538323434373539372e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\"394\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n<br>394. \nAs the last scoop of soil was placed, they finally finished burying the dead body. \nEveryone was sad, but mostly anxious because they didn’t actually know what happened. \n“This is all bullshit.” \nSergeant Min spoke.—\n“Everything is bullshit. I don’t think I can trust any of you now.” \nThe Sergeant said, “Sergeant would you please lower your voice—“ \n“YOU!” Sergeant Min pointed at Jungkook. \n“I’m so tired of all your orders thinking that it will make anything less worse!”—\nJungkook just stood there, listening to his words that he know it may hurt him. \n“You told us to trust each other but now do you see this?!” He pointed at the grave. \n“You’re the worse Captain, the worse leader.”—\nEveryone was silent, shocked at the words thrown out. But some of them though he had a point. \n“I only said trust each other. But I did not say ‘let them fool you’. You can trust people, thats not your fault. But the blame is on you if you let them fool you.”—\nJungkook said, expression still as hard as stone but Tae knew how much he’s hurting inside. \nHe’s still a person after all. \n“Are you saying that I’m dumb?!” \nSergeant tried to attack and come at him, but some trainees stopped it.—\n“What if you’re just setting us up? What if you’re actually the one causing this?” \nTae felt angry, he knew it was behind the line. “Stop it! How dare you blame people?” \nSergeant shook everyone that’s holding him.—\n“Everyone, if you believe in my words that Captain Jeon is the actual suspect, cross the line and go to my side.” \nSince they were standing in both opposing directions, it was easy to tell. \nSome hesitated to take a step, but as soon as one did, many did too.—\n“Are you insane?!” Namjoon cried, feeling so hopeless at the amount of soldiers who crossed the line. \nSergeant Min smirked, “See? Lots of people suspect you.” \nBut Jungkook was thankful for those who stayed behind him, even if its just a few.—\n“Then go,” Jungkook spoke, and Sergeant raised a brow. “What?” \n“Go. Leave MY territory.” \nSergeant couldn’t utter a word for that, and the people on his side felt a bit nervous. \n“Let’s live on our now. Good luck on surviving.”\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/7a411a063fbc64821ba70129ae134e0a2fa16a3a/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f325637774b62596e4543345666413d3d2d3132332e3136616234666131363261646164373632373232393138303038392e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"”\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/b96689c84f7ac197aac2795c40de9338dfef5f96/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f31433156524f37744d3633574c413d3d2d3132332e313661623466613162356534306633353638333037383938303237352e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/e19afe1b51355ae9c2025aa47e6ddb3adead1c3d/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f4b325955613448776678536157773d3d2d3132332e313661623466613233616466636538383439393134353833313330312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/a03e6291b7c3319579eaf0b3636542f2c999876d/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f58427679335338566d75783775673d3d2d3132332e313661623466613263353133643533653936353133383137313535342e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"494\" alt=\"394\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n<br>394.\nIt was a quiet afternoon, maybe because of what happened earlier. \nThere are still some soldiers left with Jungkook, and luckily, they’re enough to protect each other.\nTae can walk a bit now, but he still needs support. And he’s glad that everyone is willing to help him.—\n“Thanks, hyung.” He told Seokjin as he help him sit down on the ring of the tree.\n“I don’t really get those trainees who crossed the line.” Seokjin said, he wanted to talk about it to give Tae assurance that he trusts Jungkook.\n“Do you trust our Captain?”—\nSeokjin chuckled. “I wouldn’t be here if I don’t.”\n“And I told you, I know Jungkook even before I become a trainee. He’s really dedicated and honest. I know he’ll never do those kind of things.” \nTae was silent, and he noticed. Seokjin patted his back.—\n“Don’t worry, I talked to the others, and thats what they thought too. We’ll trust Captain no matter what. Besides, he’s the reason why most of us survived.”\nSeokjin left, giving Tae privacy as Jungkook finally arrive. \n“Hyung, I think I know who the traitor is.”—\nJungkook guided him into the tent, they need some talk.\n“Who?” Tae asked, feeling nervous. He’s been wanting to know who and Jungkook was really amazing if he’ll know.\n“There are two, actually.” \nTae’s eyes bawled. “Two?!”—\nJungkook nodded and placed his index finger in front of Tae’s lip to make him quiet. \n“The other one is a coward, and I don’t think he’s sticking to what he’s asked to do. And the other is just an obedient as a dog.”\nTae’s brows furrowed. \n“So who?”—\n“Its Hugo and Sergent Min. Hugo was tasked to lure us and kill us but he’s not doing it and I don’t know why. And Sergeant Min, he’s trying to put the blame on me so that he won’t be suspicious. But he just lured himself out.”\nTae felt scared of what might happen.—\n“Why are we still not getting rid of Hugo?”\n“I believe he has a reason why he’s not killing us yet. And I think we can use him.”\n“Use him? For wh—aH!”\nTae felt that throbbing pain in his head again, the same thing he felt before the bomb explodes.—\n“Hyung, what’s happening?” Jungkook felt worried as he watch Tae hold his head.\n“Shit, agh!” Tae cried, his tears forming in the side of his eyes out of pain. \n“Doctor Hye!” Jungkook called as he held Tae in his arms. The doctor came quickly.—\nSome of their medical soldier staffs came in to check on Tae. \n“Hyung?” Jungkook asked, not hearing what he said. \n“The eye is the mirror of the soul!” Tae cried, saying it in a fast way because his head is hurting so much.\nJungkook went blank for a second, and it hit him.—\nJungkook quickly got up and left the tent. The doctor and nurses were holding Tae as they try to calm him down and ease the pain.\n“Hagh!” Tae cried, eyes shut forcefully. \nJungkook came back in, holding a mirror. He knelt down, and showed it to Tae. \n“Tae, open your eyes!”—\nBut Tae did not listen, because he was much in pain to even listen to his surroundings.\n“KIM TAEHYUNG OPEN YOUR EYES!” Jungkook shouted, &amp; Tae knew he needed to open his eyes even if it hurts.\nHe forced to open the hoods of his eyes, meeting his own reflection in the mirror.—\nBut even if Tae saw himself, he knew it wasn’t him.\nBecause his reflection was staring back at him with surprise in their eyes. \nIt was the other Tae. \nTae looked at him straight, and he saw that he’s slowly groaning in some specific pain.—\nIt was like its mirroring his pain, and at some certain point, Tae can feel that the headache was slowly fading away.\nThe other Tae was holding onto his head now, like how Tae was holding it earlier.\nDid he just give him headaches too? \nDid he just control him now?\n\n      <img

His aunt? His younger brother? \nHe sighed, he missed them, so much.—\nBut he was still wondering, how could he take over that other Taehyung like how he did earlier? \nOr is that other Tae still doing fine there? \nThoughts were a mess on his head, but who can blame him? Everythings a mess now.—\nThe parting of the tent opened, the light of the moon shone inside. \n“How are you doing now?” Jungkook asked, stepping inside and sitting beside Tae. \n“I’m doing quite fine...for now.” He sadly said, fidgeting the mirror. He feels a bit anxious.—\n“What...actually happened earlier?” Jungkook carefully asked, not wanting to press the wrong buttons that can make Tae feel more anxious. \n“I think, every time he’s trying to control me, my head aches. And it hurts so bad.”—\n“But thank you for helping me out awhile ago, I know you could solve the riddle.” \nJungkook looks distracted, he was just holding Tae’s hand, caressing it. And he’s quietly staring at the blank. \nTae knew there was something wrong.—\nHe held his hand too, and that made Jungkook jump out of his thoughts. \n“Something you wanna tell me?” He asked. And Jungkook thought, that maybe he’s bad at hiding his emotions when it comes to Taehyung. \nHe just make him feel so weak and soft.—\n“I just...I feel like exploding.” Jungkook started. \n“With what happened earlier, I feel like they all suspect me now, that they don’t trust me anymore. I think I’m really a bad leader af—“ \nTae squeezed his hands tight that It made Jungkook flinch. “Ouch!”—\nJungkook cried. “Don’t you ever say that again because its not true! If you’re a bad leader then you could’ve not brought us this far!” \nTae knew Jungkook would doubt himself after that, and he just hate that he doesn’t realize his worth. \nThe younger sighed.—\n“I’m so tired hyung, I wanna cry.” \nJungkook leaned his head onto Tae’s shoulder, and hugged his arm. \nTae felt the pain in there, he forgot that Jungkook is also a person. Who’s meant to get tired, to do stupid things and to have limits. \nAnd that makes us a person.—\n“I have a lot in my head, I feel so angry that my anger turns to tears. I hate being pressured, &amp; all my life I was. I’m trying to act tough because I don’t want my people to see their own Captain in a weak state.” \nTae felt the cloth on his shoulder getting wet. He’s crying.—\nTae had no words, he just let him cry like that and hold his hands to comfort him. \nThey both fell asleep in that state, thinking that everything would be less worse tomorrow. \nBut tomorrow hasn’t even came and yet its getting even worse.—\nAn explosion was heard from outside the tent, and the trainees were making a fuss outside. \nSounds of gunshots, knives, swords and groans were heard. \nJungkook was woken up, feeling his surroundings. And he finally realized it. \n“Fuck they found us.”—\nTae raised his head up, eyes fluttering as he adjust to the light. He just woke up. \n“What’s goin—“ \n“Baby, I need you to run.” \nTae’s brows furrowed. “I can’t run yet, what’s happen—“ \nAn explosion was heard near their tent.—\nJungkook held Tae’s hand and looked at him eye to eye. \nHe was trying to think of some other way that can save Tae because he knew that he can’t fight yet. \n“Jung—what are you doing?!” Tae cried. \nJungkook suddenly grabbed the sharp stone from the small opening of the tent.— tw // self harm ❗️\nHe started rubbing it harshly on the skin of his arm like he’s purposely wounding himself. \nTae held his wrist to stop him. “Jeon, stop that! Are you crazy?!” \n“Yeah, over you.” \nHe smacked Jungkook’s arm. “Its not funny!”—\nJungkook’s arm was now bleeding, and he quickly wiped his blood and damped it on Tae’s clothes. \n“What-?” Tae asked, feeling so confused. \n“Pretend you’re dead.” \nJungkook continued damping his blood onto his clothes and even arms to make it realistic.—\n“You can’t run, &amp; I won’t let you fight yet. They need me out there, &amp; this is all you could do to be saved.” \nJungkook said as he lay down Taehyung. \n“Please be careful.” Tae cried in a shaky voice. \nJungkook leaned forward &amp; placed a kiss on his forehead. “I’ll be back.”—\nAnd those were Jungkook’s last words before he went out, and Tae did not know what happened next. \nHe just laid there, feeling so scared. \nLike what if something explodes near him? What if the opponents check the tent and see him? \nWell fuck.<br>—\nBecause even while he’s just thinking of that, a bullet suddenly hit the tent and it flew just right above his head. \nIt was very near that he’s thankful it did not hit him. He’s suspecting its a sniper because of the bullet. \nWhat a dumb sniper, I guess?—\nWhile Tae was inside the tent acting for his life, Jungkook had already fought some opponents even if he just came out. \nThe whole territory was a mess, and some were on fire. There are also dead bodies around and he’s afraid that its some of his people.—\nBut they were lucky that those people had backed out already. Maybe because a lot of their people died now. \nA lot were injured, some unfortunately died. And Jungkook had a shot in his arm. \n“Captain, they’re gone.” Ta soldier came running, its their watch-man.—\nJungkook was panting for breath, and feeling his shot aching. \n“That’s not a good news. They found us already, there’s a big possibility that they’ll come back. We’re not safe here anymore.” \nJungkook stood up, holding his bleeding arm.—\n“Everyone! Gather all your belongings and anything useful. We’re leaving this place before the day rise.” \nJungkook said, and thought that he shouldn’t have let his guard down. Because its very predictable that they’ll attack at the time that they’re most vulnerable.—\nTae came out from the tent, hearing Jungkook’s announcement. \nHe forced himself to stand up, even though his injury still stings. And its was more than enough for Jungkook to see him alive and safe. \nHe felt so drained in overall, but he can’t give up now.—\nAfter getting ready, they left the place with heaviness in their hearts. They lost some people again, and they knew they might lose more in the future. \nIt was just scary that they didn’t know who they’ll lose next. \n“We’re running out of stored food sir.”—\n“The bullets and equipments also. We still have some of them but I don’t think it will be enough to protect us anymore.” \nLieutenant Jung said, feeling worried. \nThey were walking towards no one knows where. They just need to get away from that place as much as possible.—\n“We can hunt some animals in the way.” Jungkook said. \nThe soldiers from behind were surprised when one of them flopped on the ground. \nDoctor Hye checked his pulse, and looked at them with disappointment in his eyes. \n“He’s dead. He didn’t make it anymore.”—\nJungkook sighed, he looked at his people, one by one. And his heart just ached at their looks, stained with wounds and blood, and they look overly drained. \n“Let’s walk until over there, then we’ll take a short rest after that.” He ordered.—\nBut even before they could go there, a huge group of people were in front of them — point out their spears and torches onto them. \nThe soldiers were alarmed and took out their guns, pointing it to those people too. \nFuck, did they just run into rebels?<br>399. \nEveryone was alert and still, not wanting to be taken advantage of again. \nThose people were on their casual everyday clothes, but stained with some muds and blood. I mean, its world war so nothing new. \nIts just scary that they don’t know if they can trust them.—\nBut that person, who looks like the leader, slowly placed down his spear. \n“Captain Jeon?” He spoke. \nJungkook’s brows furrowed, still not letting his guard down. “Who are you?” He asked. \nThe person removed his hat that was covering his face.—\nJungkook immediately remembered him. “Lieutenant Lee?” \nHe was so surprised to see him here, because he was actually trying to find him in the camp but he couldn’t. Since Lt. Lee was relocated out of misunderstandings. \n“I’m glad you still remember me.”—\nJungkook raised his hand, showing his people that its okay, and put their guns down. \n“How can I forget the person who took care of me when I was a trainee?” Jungkook placed back the gun in his pocket. \nHe was glad to see him again, he was like a father to him.—\nLt. Lee signaled his people behind him to put their spears down now. \nJungkook has a lot of questions, but he needs to fix them in line for now. “What happened to all of you?” He asked. \nLt. Lee sighed, “They didn’t actually relocate me to a new camp.”—\n“They just fired me out. It was unjustifiable.” He said, feeling a bit angry about those people he served for the longest and yet they did not even treat him well. \n“Who are they, sir?” \nSergeant Kim asked, being familiarized with their Lieutenant.—\n“We’re in one neighborhood. We escaped the place where a lot of people we’re still jailed. Some were killed, and most of the women are used for pleasure.” \nJungkook noticed that Lee’s grip on the spear was tightened. \n“They killed my daughter.”—\nJungkook would never know the pain of losing a child, because he’s never been a parent. But he knew how much it hurts to loose a loved one. \n“I’m sorry sir.” Jungkook apologized. \nSuddenly, a kid from Lee’s side ran towards Taehyung. \n“Taehyungie hyung!”—\nThe kid gave him a gentle hug, he was stained with mud and some bruise. \n“Taehyeol?” Tae smiled when he realized that it was that kid from the arcades. \nHe felt so touched that Taehyeol still remembered him. \n“I’m so glad to see you again!” Tae cried.—\nBut Tae also felt sad for him, because this kid doesn’t deserve experiencing things like this. \nHe’s so strong. \nEveryone felt touched too, but they need to get on the business. \n“Captain, would you like to go with us?” Lee asked. \n“Where?”—\n“We’re on the way to the capital to try and save some people. And the president, they trying to make him surrender his position.” \nJungkook somehow felt something when he heard the word ‘president’. \n“Who are we actually gonna save? The president, or the people?”—\n“Both, if possible. The president is useless without the people, and the people is in danger without a president.” \nJungkook sighed, his thoughts are unhelpfully scattered. \n“But sir, if we’re gonna do that, we need more &amp; stronger equipments.”—\n“We need more people and a concrete plan before we attack.” A soldier spoke. \n“The equipments are easy to get. Just shoot the opponents and steal their guns. But the people and plans, we need to talk about that first.” \nLieutenant Lee said, and Jungkook accepted the offer.—\nNot just for himself, not just for his people, but its because that’s his job. \nThey temporarily stopped in where they are to get a bit of rest and heal. And also, to have some plan. \n“What happened to your leg, hyung?” Taehyeol asked, curiously looking.—\n“Oh this?” Tae held his leg that’s bandaged. “I ran into an accident, but I’m okay.” \nHe ruffled the kid’s hair. They were sitting under the tree. Some were talking to each other and sharing food like a family. \nSome were offering help. Tae smiled.\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/17ff3f8603b47e0d0d07e4a91981cd9c2e16605a/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f69502d544d65706b517a343236413d3d2d3132342e313661623530336637356237646235333931303234353331353930302e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\" Tae smiled\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/9622d9af7ed7dd861b6bc4654f0a1d3e86869b87/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f7764656c75355654796e495a78413d3d2d3132342e313661623530336662383636363037323135373732353931333339302e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"494\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/8e47f55128d8e1480a0c2d98be01457aa0c6dcb6/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f332d483878715043684b592d34673d3d2d3132342e313661623530343034646164343961383534343133393330363233312e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"494\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/c94fa924343180595174581573491bf34060aab4/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f6232635556446b4162656d6e77673d3d2d3132342e313661623530343063653834336433623934333836363432353336302e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n<br>401. \nAfter they have a talk about the plan, they started dividing people into groups so that it would be easier to do their plans at the sane time. \n“We need one more sniper,” Lieutenant Lee said, counting all the people on his group. \n“We don’t have any sniper left.”—\nJungkook said, also feeling a bit worried by the lack of people. \n“I volunteer.” Tae spoke, and Jungkook’s eyes bawled. \n“Are you sure? You don’t look so well.” Lt. Lee said, trying not to sound offensive.—\n“A sniper only stays in 1 place to aim for their target. They rarely run or do anything other than aiming. And I really wanted to help, so I think that’s the least I can do.” \nTae anxiously said, he didn’t want to be a burden in their team. \nSergeant Kim agreed.—\n“Don’t worry sir. I’ve seen him in trainings, he has the potential to be a sniper.” He said. \nLt. Lee nodded, knowing that Tae has a point. “Okay, you’re on my team—“ \n“He’s mine.” Jungkook spoke, but he realized it. \n“I-I mean he’s on my side, let’s exchange snipers.”—\nTae lowkey looked away, hiding his flustered face. \nLt. Jung shook his head, “Captain, everything’s planned already. We can’t just exchange people like that.” \n“But—“ Jungkook tried to speak again, but Tae insisted. \n“It’s okay Captain, I can handle myself.”—\nJungkook wanted to complain, but Tae looked at him in the eye to say that he doesn’t have to worry. \nAnd Jungkook couldn’t do anything anymore but sigh. “Fine.” \nThey talked a little bit to clarify everything.—\n“We need to get to the Capital and save the prostitutes before the sun rise. I heard they’re gonna kill them at 6 or 7.” \nLieutenant said, “My side is on the people, yours is on the president. I hope we’re all clear now.” \nJungkook spoke, and they all agreed.—\nIts probably around 12 in the morning now, and they need to start walking now if they want to save those prostitutes. \n“Let’s prepare for 10 minutes, then we’ll go.” \nEveryone did their business, some did all their rituals thinking that it might help them.—\nBut Jungkook, he signaled Tae behind the huge tree, the trunk enough to hide them from everyone, and only the moon can see them. \nTae arrived behind, seeing Jungkook look so troubled. \n“Hey, its okay. I’ll be fine.” Tae cupped his cheeks to cheer him up.—\nJungkook looks like he’s hesitating, but he said fuck it. \nHe held Tae’s hand from his cheeks and kissed the back of it. \n“Hyung...I just wanted to do something before we go.” \nTae felt curious, and nervous at the same time.\n“What is it?”—\nJungkook pulled something from his pocket, Tae couldn’t actually see because it was dark. \nBut it was enough for him to realize when Jungkook suddenly knelt down on the ground, holding a ring before him. \nTae flung his hands onto his mouth, covering it out of shock.—\nJungkook was actually expecting that reaction, and he smiled a bit as his heart jump. \nHe pulled Tae’s hand and held it. \n“I know it’s the wrong time to do this, but I wanted to make sure that whatever happens, we’ll forever be tied to each other, and no one else.”—\n“My grandmother gave me this, she told me to give it to the person I’m sure that I will love the most. And I finally found that person, named Kim Taehyung.” \nWith held sobs, Tae’s tears kept falling down his cheeks out of happiness. \n“Will you do the honor of marrying me?”—\nTae instantly nodded non-stop, not being able to say a word because of his sobs. But he still managed it. \n“I fucking do.” He cried and Jungkook laughed, heart feeling overwhelmed. \nHe gently slid the ring into Tae’s finger, feeling proud that finally, he said it.—\nAs Jungkook stood up, there’s no way a kiss wouldn’t happen. \nHe gently pulled Tae forward, aiming for his lips that he’ll never have enough of. \nHe’ll never get tired of him, he just knew it. \nBut as much as they don’t want it to last, they have to part.—\nThey leaned their foreheads onto one another, arms around each other’s frames, and hearts entangled. \n“I love you so much.” \n“I love you more than words.” \nBut it was interrupted when they heard Lee. “Everyone! We have to go.”—\nJungkook quickly pulled out a letter from his pocket, then handed it to Tae. \n“I have so much to say, I know I will forget them when this time comes so I wrote them down.” \nTae held the letter from his hand. \n“Make sure you have all your belongings!”—\n“I don’t know what might happen, but when the war ends, I’ll wait for you on that tree. Whatever happens, I’ll be there. And I hope, I’ll see you there too.” \nTae nodded, wiping his tears away. \n“I will. I’ll see you there.”—\nJungkook placed a last kiss on Tae’s forehead, not wanting to let go. \nBut they have to. \n“Where’s Captain—“ \n“I’m here sir.” Jungkook came out from behind the tree, and Tae did too on the darker side so that no one would notice.\n—\n“Let’s go.” \nSteps made away from the place that kept them safe, they’re finally taking it to another level. \nNot because they just want to, but because a lot of lives depend on them now. \nAnd maybe, \nThis is just where the real war starts.\nSanaol😭😭😭<br>Sanaol😭😭😭\nSanaol may jowa 😭💗\nOk&nbsp; andami nito ahh \nAs always \nMabuhay kayo hanggang gusto nyo!\n"},{"title":"103","data":"402. \nThe groups had split up, even with the fear and nervousness in their hearts, they had to do it. \nWhat if they’re the only hope? \nThe plan has started, right now, Lt. Lee’s group has arrived in the President’s palace.—\n“They’re up in the 4th floor, the President is held captive there. Taehyung, you know what to do.” \nTae nodded, holding tight onto his gun. Their faces were somehow covered with cloth to prevent them from being recognized by the opponents.—\n“We’ll get the hostages, we’ll see each other on the ground floor. Please be safe.” \nThose were Lt. Lee’s words before they split up. Leaving Tae, Namjoon, and some other people to do their plan. \n“I’ve been here, so I memorized the whole place.” Namjoon said.—\nThey carefully started moving, avoiding every place where there are opponents. \nThey finally made it into the 3rd floor stairs that is the way up to the 4th floor. \nBut there was one problem. \n“Fuck, there are soldiers. What are we gonna do?” A person with them whispered.—\nTae sighed, he checked the bullets available for his gun, thinking that he can shoot them from afar. \nBut he felt disappointed. \n“I only have 3 bullets left. I don’t think I can shoot them with the gun.”—\nBut you know, one always have to sacrifice. \nNamjoon stepped forward, they were hiding behind the wall. \n“I’ll bait myself, I’ll distract them.” \nNamjoon looked at those two soldiers guarding the stairs.—\n“They’re Korean soldiers, I can tell from their uniforms. We have the same uniform as them, so I don’t think they’ll recognize that I’m not one of them.” \nThe group felt a bit worried, but they need to trust him if they want to succeed.—\nNamjoon stepped out behind the wall, pulling his most serious face, copying how those soldiers hold the gun in their arm. \nHe saluted as he went in front of them, \n“General Kim has an order, he needs you both in the office.”\nHe lied.—\nBut he was alarmed when the two soldiers held their gun, pointing at him. \n“You impostor!” One cried, and Namjoon realized it. \nThey have a little red cloth pinned in their clothes, maybe indicating that they’re now in the American’s side. \nNamjoon knew he had to run now.—\n“Good job, you found out.” \nNamjoon joked, and quickly ran away as fast as he could because those two soldiers were after him now. \n“Let’s go!” Their fellow soldier, Hyun shouted. \nThey immediately ran towards the stairs and went up.—\nWithout knowing that there’s another one waiting for them. \n“Opponents!” Another two soldiers were guarding the stairs up too. \nThey point their guns at them, but Tae spoke. \n“Whatever happens, don’t shoot or we’ll lure more soldiers here.”—\nAnd yeah, physical fight? \nLuckily, Tae is with the soldiers who’s good at martial arts. He only had to elbow the opponents and they did the rest. \nCuz it just sucks that he can’t fight yet. \nFortunately, they knocked down the soldiers.—\nBut they’re just 50% lucky because from what the opponent shouted earlier, they knew more soldiers will come soon. \n“Over here!” Min whisper-shouted from behind the walls, signaling them.\nThey quickly got to hide even before another group of soldiers catch them again.—\n“Look over the place! I’m sure they haven’t gone far yet!” \nThe opponents shouted, they were looking for them now and looks like they alarmed the whole place. \nIt’ll be harder to do the plan now, but life goes on I guess?—\nThey waited for the opponents to be gone, before they can finally speak with each other. \n“There’s the president!” Hyun whisper-shouted, pointing out from the window. \nThey were down the ground, and the President was tied in a wooden pole, fire pit from beyond him.—\n“You’ll have a good shot here Tae, I hope you get General Reiner. We’ll guard you from the outside.” \nA member patted his back, as theu slowly make their way outside, watching out for Tae. \nTae crouched, his injury somehow aching because of the running.—\nHe took another look from down the window. \nHostages were down there too, there are lots of dead bodies around. And the surroundings looks like a ghost town because of the fires and explosions. \nIt was all a mess. \nAnd Tae had the chance to fix this mess.—\nHe loaded the long gun with a bullet, feeling a bit nervous of what he’s gonna do. \nIt’s his first time to kill a person, but he felt less guilt now because the person he’s aiming for wasn’t necessary in this world. \nHe positioned the gun from the window.—\nHe looked into the target hole, focusing it on Reiner’s head. \nThey looked like they’re trying to convince him to surrender, but the President kept insisting, thats why he’s almost getting burned down. \nTae placed a finger on the trigger button.—\nReady to pull the trigger as the target is now in a fixed state. \nBut Tae flinched when the door was forced open. \n“TAEHYUNG SHOOT NOW!—“ Hyuk was shot dead on the floor. \nTae’s eyes bawled as he saw a soldier come in, gun pointed at him.<br>—\nThe soldier pulled the trigger and it almost hit Tae’s arm, but he luckily dodged it. \nHe saw that there was another door inside the room, and that’s his only hope. \nHe grabbed his gun and stood up, quickly running towards that door. \n“HEY! STOP THERE!”—\nBut Tae thought ‘fuck’. \nBecause the door was just towards another room. There was no other door, and only an open window. \nTae bit his lip, “Fuck, its now or never.” \nHe quickly hopped onto the frame of the window, almost falling from the 4th floor.—\n“YOU CANT ESCAPE NOW!” \nRight before the soldier pulled the trigger, Tae jumped down the window, and the opponents were quite surprised. \n“Did he just kill himself?” A soldier asked him, walking towards the window.—\nThey all looked down, trying look if there’s a corpse on the ground. \nBut they couldn’t identify who he is among all the dead bodies down the building. \n“I think he’s dead.” A soldier cried, but their Sergeant spoke. \n“He’s not, he survived.”—\n“Search down the 4th floor! He’s still around here!” And they all started searching. \nBut Taehyung, he was just beyond that window of the 4th floor. \nHe just jumped down and went inside the window of 3rd floor, staying there in the frames coz there are other soldiers inside.—\nHis body was shaking, because he almost fell down. \nHis injury wasn’t helping at all because it was hurting so bad right now. “Phew, I can do this.” \nHe cheered himself. After he knew that he calmed down, he slowly took little steps towards the inside of the window.—\nHis hands were sweaty but he still tried to hold onto the frames for support. \nHe was almost there, he’s almost shooting Reiner. Fuck it. \n“I need to get back there.” He told himself. \n“If not, then I need to find another place to kill him.”—\nBut Tae was caught off-guard when his foot stepped on the wrong place and he slipped. \n“Ah!” He cried, hanging down the window, and his hand was luckily holding onto the frame. \nBut since his hand was sweaty, he knew his grip won’t last long. \n“Shit.” He cursed.—\nHe raised his other hand, placing it to hold onto the frames again to atleast make his grip stronger. \nBut his other hand slipped, and he’ll never feel more hurt. \nBecause the ring — the engagement ring that Jungkook proposed to him, slipped and fell down.—\nHis eyes getting blurry because of tears. “No!” He cried, as he watch the ring fall down the ground. \nHe felt so angry at himself for loosing it. And he did not feel good about it. \nHe felt that the other grip of his hand is slowly loosening.—\nHis arms and hand hurts to bad now, and he suddenly lost all his strength because of what happened. \nHe suddenly remembered what the fairy told him. \nIf he dies here, he can never reincarnate and go back to the future.—\nHe slowly closed his eyes, and maybe, he had to accept it. \nA tear fell down, “I’m sorry Jungkook,” he paused. \n“But I don’t think I can see you in that tree anymore.” He said. \nAnd with that, he fully lost all his strength and let go of his grip.—\nHe knew everything will end soon, but he did not realize that it was THIS soon. \nHe had so many plans, so many things to do with himself and the love of his life. \nHe still dreamt of marrying him, and making a family with him. \nBut I guess, it’ll remain as dreams now.—\nBut with a single snap, within the light of the heavens, he opened his eyes. \nSurprised that he’s still hanging up there, not hitting the ground. \nAnd he felt a tight grip on his wrist. \nHe looked up, unexpected to see a familiar face. \n“Bogum?”—\nEyes bawled, Tae couldn’t believe what he’s seeing. \nBogum placed back his gun beside him and held Tae’s wrist with his both hands, pulling him up. \n“Yes, what a beautiful name right?” He flashed his gummy smile. \nAnd Tae missed it so much.—\nTae shed more tears, he felt so much emotions right now. \n“Wha—how—wh—“ \n“Remember when I told you that I’ll never leave you?” \nHe chuckled, feeling hurt to see Tae crying again. \n“Oh come on! Give me your other hand! You can’t die yet idiot.”—\nTae gathered all his strength left and raised his other hand. \nIt took some time, but Bogum successfully pulled him up. \nTae flopped on the ground, feeling so weak in overall. Everything was just surprising and exhausting today. \n“No thank you’s?” Bogum joked.\n—\nTae quickly got up from the floor and smacked his chest repeatedly. \n“You! Fuck you! You’re so stubborn!” Tae’s tears kept falling down out of frustration. \nAnd Bogum was actually expecting it. He held Tae’s hands, preventing him from hitting him again.—\n“I missed you too.” He giggled, quite having fun of teasing Tae. \nTaehyung quickly kneed him, and Bogum crouched a bit in pain. “Aw!” \nTae was almost losing his breath of his sobs, he didn’t know what to feel. \n“I told you to stay in Australia! You’re much safer there!”—\nBogum scratched his head, and laughed. \n“What’s funny?!” Tae cried, Bogum thought he’s cute even when he’s angry cuz he knew that Tae was just worried. \n“Tae, I can’t leave my own country while a war is ongoing. Anyways, what’s the plan?”\n"},{"title":"104","data":"403. \nAlmost getting caught, but hiding is still an effective way. \nRight now, Bogum and Tae were trying to escape all the soldiers around that is trying to look for them. \n“We have to get to that room.” \nTae whispered, referring to the room a bit far from them.—\nBogum sighed, “I think we need to shoot.” \nHe lifted his gun and aimed for the soldier standing there. But Tae held his arm to stop him. \n“No! They’re gonna hear the sound.” \nBogum smirked, he was prepared for this. “It’s silencer.”\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/4bb07558bcf7e70b31096bfa271511de91f65d9b/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f534245335a514671626e587771773d3d2d3132362e313661623530636363393661346365393331313331343534353938392e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"442\" alt=\"405\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n<br>405. \nWithout even a single sound of a shot, they successfully killed every soldier in that ground.\nWell maybe not all, but still enough to keep them going. \nThey entered the room, and Tae was right — he’ll have a better view here to shoot properly.—\n“Where are you going?” Tae asked, as he saw Bogum leaving the room. \n“I’ll be your lookout. Please shoot immediately, they’ll find us soon.” \nThose were his words before he close the door. Tae did not waste anytime. \nHe quickly loaded his gun and pointed it down at Reiner.—\nPlacing his thumb on the trigger, an eye on the target hole. He felt a bit nervous because something doesn’t sit right. \nAnd he was correct. \nBecause as soon as he was about to pull the trigger, \nHis head started aching again. \n“Fuck, not again!”—\nBut he was more distracted on what he did next. \nBecause out of pain, out of surprise, he unconsciously pulled the trigger and it made a loud sound. \n“Agh! Fuck it!” He cried, groaning at the pain. \nBut he did shoot Reiner — on the arm. \nHis goal was actually on the head.—\nHe quickly pulled in his gun, managing to move even out of all the pain he’s having. \nHis hands were shaking as he rummaged into his bag, looking for the mirror. \nBogum kicked the door as he fisted a soldier down, \n“Tae we have to go!”—\nHe was quite busy fighting the opponents to even notice that Tae was suffering. \nBut Tae got in quick — just a quick look into the mirror, like a staring contest with himself — but its not actually him. \nHe’s glad it still worked, because the pain eventually went away.—\nCatching he breath before he placed the mirror back into his bag, he quickly got up, running away with Bogum. \n“Shit! Shit! They’re after us now!” Bogum cursed. \nAnd Tae felt so mad at himself for having an injury. He can’t run as quick as he can.—\n“Go!” Tae stopped in the middle of running, holding onto the wall as his injury is bleeding again, and he couldn’t take the pain anymore. \nBogum stopped in his tracks, looking back with a confused face. “Are you crazy?!” \nThe soldiers running after them were almost close.—\nTears were on the side of his eyes, but he knew he had to be brave. \nTae showed off his smile, “I won’t make it. Go now! You have to save yourself.” \nBogum was contemplating if he should go, or if he should stay. \n“Taehyung you can’t do this shit!”—\nThe opponents just a meter close, and Tae had to do it — he knew he had to. \nHe pulled out a grenade from his bag, holding it onto his chest before he spoke. \n“Please tell Jungkook that I’m sorry.” He smiled. \nAs he threw the grenade behind, he knew it was the end of him.—\nIt was the second time — the 2nd fucking time he thought he’ll be gone. \nBut Bogum — even afterall the pain he caused him, even if he couldn’t give back the love he deserves, \nHe’s always there, whether he needed him, or not. \nAnd you know, that’s what we all need the most.—\nAs soon as the grenade exploded, a huge disaster was made. \nBut Taehyung wasn’t much damaged, because Bogum scooped him up in his arms and ran away before it does. \nThey were thrown onto the ground because of the huge impact of the explosion.—\nOnly bruising their arms, and they were glad that its all that. \nTae coughed at the smoke, the building is on fire. “You shouldn’t have done that.” Tae cried. \nBogum slowly stood up with the pain in his arms, he chuckled. \n“And you shouldn’t have done that either.”—\nThey heard footsteps running towards their direction. And they knew that they have to go now. \n“They’re coming. We have to escape now.” Bogum said, helping Tae stand up. \n“But I haven’t killed Reiner yet—“ \n“Atleast you wounded him. That’s enough for now.”—\nBut even before Tae could walk, Bogum carried him in his back — like a piggy ride. \n“What the—put me down!” Tae insisted, feeling flustered at what he did. \n“You think you can run now with ur injury bleeding? Tough luck Mr. Kim.”—\nThey ran — I mean — Bogum ran as he carry Tae behind him, trying to escape the huge amount of soldiers after them. \nAnd all what Tae could do was shoot them from behind him, using Bogum’s silencer to prevent creating sounds. \n“I think we need to run into the forest.”—\nTae got caught off guard, but he was to late to complain because they’re already inside the forest. \n“We can’t stay here! A lot of—“ \nBogum instantly crouched when he heard a gunshot. And Tae was right. \nThere’s another exchanging of bullets going on here.<br>—\n“See? It a lot dangerous here!” \nBut Tae was stopped talking when he saw two soldiers holding someone with his head in a sack, and the hands were tied. \nTheyre going into the callesa. \n“There’s the President!” Tae cried as he pointed to that person.—\n“I don’t think we can save the President.” Bogum said. \nJust by looking around as they hide behind the trees, there are lots of soldiers in the forest — dead and live. \nThey don’t even know who their team is — or if their team is even in here.—\n“There they are!” They both heard a soldier shouted, and they knew he’s referring at them. \n“Fuck, I need a horseshoe.” Bogum said as he quickly ran away. Tae laughed a bit even tho he knows its not the time for that. \n“Okay, horsie.”—\n“Put me down.” Tae ordered, as Bogum continued running. \n“Shut up, you can’t run yet.” Tae knew he was tired, because he’s heavy enough. “I said put me down.” \nWith his voice, Bogum had no choice. He went behind the trees and put down Tae. \n“What’re u gonna do?” He asked.—\nTae looked away towards the middle of the forest — where he recognized that the other side was their team, and the other was not. \nHe pulled out a grenade, he knew it was enough to atleast lessen the opponents. \nHe quickle threw it towards the opponents side.—\nHe crouched a bit at the explosion, even tho it was somehow far from them so they’re not that affected. \n“That’s nice—“ A gunshot was heard. \nTae flinched, turning around to see what happened. \nAnd he thought he shouldn’t have.—\nBecause Bogum — he was shot on the chest. \nMaybe that’s why his sentence was cut off coz he noticed that an opponent was gonna shoot Tae. \nTypical movies — he blocked the shot. \nTae’s mind went frozen, out of pain and anger.—\nBut everything sank into his mind Bogum slowly fell on his knees, feeling the shot in his chest. \nTae was boiling in anger — so so angry that he pulled out Bogum’s gun and uncontrollably shot that soldier multiple times. \nHe couldn’t care less if he’s a murderer now.—\nTears falling down his cheeks, he soon got back in his sanity. \nBogum was lying onto the ground, blood streaming down his own self. \nTae quickly sat down, hands shaking as he placed Bogum’s head onto his lap.—\n“I-I’m sorry I was s-so careless I—“ Tae said in between his sobs, but Bogum placed his index finger above Tae’s lips to shut him. \nBlood coming out from his mouth, he still gave him a sincere smile. \n“S-Stop acting like its a b-big-deal. I’m a big boy, I-I can handle this.”—\nTae couldn’t even see clearly now because his eyes were flooded by nonstop tears. \nHe shook his head repeatedly. “No you shut up! You’re making it harder!” \nTae stood up, and tried to lift Bogum up. “We need to get you to Doctor Hye!” He cried.—\nBut Bogum held Tae’s hand, stopping him from moving further. \nHis breath is shaky, and a tear fell down his cheeks. \nAnd even if he didn’t want to say it, but he knew it would happen. \n“Stop it,” He paused, looking straight into Tae’s eyes. \n“I won’t...make it.”—\nTae wanted to smack him, he wanted to be angry at him for being so negative. \nHe knelt down, and shook his hands off him as he angrily cried. \n“Don’t say that! You’re always the one who tells me to be positive and now you’re like this?!”—\nBogum closed his eyes, chuckling. “D-Do you mind if I t-take a small nap—“ \n“NO. Don’t you ever fucking close your eyes!” Tae cried, shaking Bogum to keep him awake. \n“But...I’m tired.” \nTae stopped, because maybe, he felt the pain right there.—\nTae held his hand, and placed it near his cheeks. “You can’t die, you WON’T DIE!” \nBogum coughed blood, “I won’t die.” \nHe opened his eyes and looked straight into Tae’s eyes. \n“I told you...I’m strong right?”—\nAnd all what Tae could do was cry, because he was too exhausted to even speak a word. \nAnd he hated that its the only thing he can do right now. \nBogum protected him at everything, saved him in the verge of dying. \nBut him, he couldn’t even save him from that bullet.—\n“I’m sorry...” Tae whispered. \nHe felt Bogum caressing his cheeks, wiping the tears falling down his eyes. \n“I’m n-not...regretting that I m-met you. I don’t care if you can’t give back my love for y-you...but I just wanted to say t-that...”—\n“I love you.” \nHe said, all eyes on Tae even if he’s having a hard time keeping them open now. \n“I’m sorry that I’m saying it just now, but I love you. E-Even more than what you thought. And I’ll always love you even if the galaxies had formed new generations.”—\nTae’s heart feels so heavy, so so heavy that he feels like passing out. \n“You don’t h-have to say it back, but I love you.” \nHe held tight onto Bogum’s hand, having so much enough of pain. \nWhy does it always have to be those good ones?<br>—\n“T-Tae...you need to r-run...” \nBogum said, even if his vision a bit blurry now, he saw that there are people running after Tae from behind. \n“Go, you have t-to run, save your life.” \nTae quickly shook his head. “No! I won’t leave you here!”—\n“I want you to s-show me that my life was worth sacrificing for y-you.” \nTae looked at him, not wanting to leave. “I can’t do this.” He said. \n“You can, you have to.” Bogum looked back, feeling a lot dizzy now because of the huge loss of blood. \n“Go! Run!”—\nEven if he doesn’t want to, he knew he had to. \nCoz he didn’t want Bogum’s sacrifice to go in waste, he won’t let that happen. \nHe ran, with all the pain in him. His injury hurting so bad, but he need to be strong. \n“Jungkook...I need to find Jungkook.” He cried as he ran.—\n“Agh!” He cried when he almost got hit by a bullet. \nHe didn’t know where to go, but his feet kept going circles. He couldn’t even see well because of his tears. \nHe looked back, trying to see if they’re still after him. \nAnd fuck, they multiplied.—\nBut as he look forward, it was too late for him to pause because he already stumbled into a ground of opponents. \nThey got him in his arms, and Tae felt so frustrated at himself. \n“Sir, we finally caught him.” The soldiers showed him to Jaewon.—\nJaewon wasn’t surprised, but not disappointed either. He just looked at Tae with no expression. \nTae felt so scared and his thoughts were all over. But atleast for this time, he had to gather himself. \n“Execute him.” Jaewon said, without even thinking twice.—\n“Yes sir!” They saluted, and immediately pulled Tae to the side to get him in the execution room. \nBut even before they could go far, Tae spoke. \n“No please! I need to talk to General!” Tae cried. \nBut they did not listen, so he had to do it. \n“Dad! Please!”—\nJaewon paused, hearing the word ‘dad’ once again that once had a space in his heart. \nHe looked at Tae, who was pleading in the arms of his soldiers. “Dad please...please...” \nJaewon thought he had killed that soft side in him already, \nBut no parent can do that.—\nHe didn’t know, but he stopped them. \n“Let him go.” Jaewon ordered, feeling a slight ache in his heart. The soldiers were surprised but they eventually let Tae go. \n“Leave us alone.” He ordered, and the soldiers did. \nTae felt anxious, fidgeting on his fingers.—\nJaewon looked at Tae before him, and he felt nostalgic looking at his son. \nThe one he raised for decades, took care a loved. But now...how did they get into their point? \n“Why did you call me dad?” He asked, trying to sound tough.—\nTae gulped, and even before he could speak, his tears went out. \nHe looked up, looking straight into his ‘father’s eyes. \n“Dad...” Tae called. “I’m sorry.” \nHe said, letting all his emotions out.—\n“I’m sorry if I disrespected and disobeyed you. I was so wrong of that. I realized that you’re just doing this for our sake. I’m sorry dad, I’m so sorry.” \nTae said in between his sobs. “I’m sorry.” He whispered, feeling so tired with his tears.—\nJaewon did not know, but he felt a pain in his heart that he’s been avoiding the most. \nBut you know, even if you flip the world, even if you change the galaxies, \nA parent, will always be a parent. \nHe softly smiled, feeling tears in his eyes.—\n“I’m sorry too son.” He said, sniffing to hold back his tears. \n“I’m sorry that I was too manipulative. I’m that I hurt you and our family. I’m sorry.” He said. \nJaewon opened his arms wide, inviting Tae for a hug. \nAnd Tae smiled, running towards him for a hug.—\nJaewon felt somehow happy, that he got to hug his son again. He was so overwhelmed. \n“Thank you for forgiving me, dad.” Tae cried. \n“Of course, I hope you do too.” \nHe said, tightening his hug around his son.—\n“Well I’m sorry,” Tae started. \n“But I will never forgive you.”\nHe pulled out the knife from behind him, and with all his heart, he stabbed Jaewon from the back. \nJaewon was so shocked, so hurt that his own son did that. \n“I’m disgusted that you’re my dad.”\nOk na tama na muna dito 😭😭\nOk \nAs always \nMabuhay kayo hanggang gusto nyo!\n"},{"title":"105","data":"Hi another parts to upload guys stay tuned guys!\n406. \nTae pushed the knife further to add more pain in the stab. Because actually, this isn’t enough for all what he’s done to him. \nJaewon groaned, shaking at the pain, and he’s unable to speak any words out of shock and hatred. \nBut maybe...he knew he deserved this.—\nTae pulled out the knife, and stepping back to unlock the hug that he thought was disgusting. \nJaewon slowly fell on the ground with his knees, and tears falling down his cheeks. \nTae had a very soft heart for feeling pity towards him, \nBut he didn’t want to forgive him.—\n“That’s not enough for all that you have done. But I’m not as evil as you.” \nTae cried, holding tight onto the knife who’s now stained in blood. \nJaewon was having a hard time on breathing, he couldn’t even speak yet. \nTae thought he should leave.—\nBecause he knew he’s just wasting his time for a very irrelevant person. \nBut even before he could take a step away, Jaewon spoke. \n“Why not just kill me?” He said, and Tae paused in his tracks. \n“You want to take revenge right? Then kill me right now.”—\nTae looked back, giving a glance at Jaewon who looks so weak right now. \nHe thought he’s right. Why not just kill him now? That wouldn’t cost his conscience because Jaewon deserved that. \nTae went close to him, holding the knife above him, ready to end Jaewon with it.—\nTae swung the knife, but he was so shocked. \nBecause even before he could stab it at him, Jaewon held his arm tight like he’s crushing him, and slowly stood up from the ground. \n“Shit!” Tae cursed as he couldn’t fight back Jaewon’s grip. \nHe’s too strong.—\n“You’re just as stupid as me.” \nJaewon pulled Tae into a hug-like, grabbed the knife from his hand and stabbed Tae from behind. \nJust like how Tae did to him. \nAnd Tae’s eyes were bawling in shock and pain. \n“I’m such a fool to let my heart soften for my son.”—\n“Without knowing that his words weren’t sincere.” \nJaewon pushed the knife further on the stab, and Tae could instantly feel sharp piercing into his body. \n“I am truly disgusted to have you as my son either.” \nJaewon whispered, feeling so much hatred.—\nHe pulled out the knife, and pushed Tae harshly on the ground. \nTae was feeling so dizzy with the amount of pain that he’s feeling. He’s turning pale because he’s been losing blood since awhile ago. \nBut now, there’s too much blood loss that he almost couldn’t breathe.—\nJaewon stood there, tears streaming down his face as he see his own son lying down the ground on his own blood. \n“I’m sorry, but I’ll never let you fool me again.” \nAnd with that, he swung another stab onto him. \nAnd blood was starting to come out from Tae’s mouth.—\nJaewon pulled out the knife, and threw it on the ground with his shaking hands. \nHe couldn’t take the guilt, but isn’t he evil enough for that? \nHe ran away, leaving Tae lying on the ground. \nTae’s vision was getting blurry, and it spinning so much.—\nHis heart was beating from his throat, and he couldn’t even feel the tears in his eyes anymore because of numbness. \nBogum’s not here anymore, Jungkook is far away. Who will save him now? \nOr will he still be saved?—\nHe couldn’t see well, but he’s aware that he’s seeing the trees above. \nAnd the light from the sky. \nMaybe this is the end for him. \nWithout any more seconds, he can feel his eyes closing. \nAnd he lost consciousness.\n[ TIME SKIP &amp; CHANGE POV ]\n—\n“Go! Go!” \nJungkook said as he guided the people out of that prison, he shot two soldiers that are trying to aim for them. \nThey had successfully escaped the people who’s held captive. Its alot of people — maybe half of the population of the Capital.—\n“We have to go!” Lieutenant Han shouted as he saw a group of opponents coming at them. \nThey’re trying to guard the people as they go outside the boundaries to keep them safe. \nIt was very harsh in the ear to hear the loud gunshots and explosions.—\n“My daughter!” Jungkook heard a woman shout in the messy crowd. \nThe people were behind them as they ran, and the soldiers were shooting at the opponents. \n“My daughter!” A woman cried.—\nJungkook saw a little girl on the ground crying, the people were stepping on her because they’re running in panic. \nThe mother was opposing the flow of the crowd to get to her daughter, but she was just washed away.\n“Mama!” The little girl cried.—\nJungkook was about to help the little girl, but then Lieutenant spoke. \n“Captain! We need your force! There’s too many of them!” He said as he continued shooting at the opponents. \nJungkook was contemplating on what should too.—\nSucks to be a Captain — who needs to do its duty while serving the people. \n“Captain we need you to shoot now!” Lt. Han said. \nBut Jungkook was too wise for that. \nHe shot the opponents as he took steps backwards, going into the direction of the little girl.\n—\nAs soon as he felt that he’s near the girl now, he quickly ducked down, and held her in his arms. \n“Shh we’re going to your mom, don’t worry.” Jungkook said as he carry the girl in his arms. \nHe stood up, facing his body&nbsp; back to prevent the girl from being shot just incase.—\n“Cover your ears.” He ordered the girl, and the little one did cover her ears. \nJungkook pulled the trigger and shot some of the opponents that he can reach with one hand. \nAnd as soon as that, he immediately looked back again, searching for the girl’s mom.—\nHe quickly found her and went towards her, he saw that she had scratches on her skin because maybe, she’s opposing the flow of the run. \nHe handed her the kid, “Please hold her tight.” Jungkook said.\nHe felt somehow happy when he saw how the mother hugged her child.—\nThe woman was crying. “Thank you so much, sir! Thank you very much!” \nJungkook nodded, “Go now! Run! Follow those soldiers and they’ll take you to a safer place.”\nHe ordered and the woman ran with her child on her arms.—\nWith a very unknown reason, Jungkook felt his heart did a sudden slide. \nHe held onto his chest, frowning at the sudden gut feeling. \n“Taehyung...” the name unconsciously slipped from his mouth and he realized it. \nHe knew something bad happened.—\nThe soldiers had taken down all the possible opponents coming at them. Right now, no one is still appearing.\nAnd they’re safe — for now. \nSuddenly, a soldier with another person in his arms came running. \nJungkook’s team immediately pointed their guns at that guy.—\nThey were alarmed like what if its another opponent? \nBut Jungkook held his hand up high, signaling the soldiers to put down their guns. \n“Its Captain Hugo.” Jungkook said as he carefully placed back his gun. \n“He’s with someone!” A soldier siad.—\nJungkook frowned, trying to recognize the person that Hugo was holding coz its hard to do it because of the blood.\nBut as soon as Hugo was close enough, Jungkook’s world fell apart. \n“I found him in the fo—“ \nBefore Hugo could finish his words, Jungkook flung a fist on him.—\nIt was safe to punch him since Tae wasn’t in his arms anymore. \nJungkook felt all the blood rise up in his head. His eyes were on fire as he look at Hugo wiping blood on the side of his lips.\n“YOU FUCKER!” Jungkook cried as he started punching him merciless.—\nDoctor Hye couldn’t focus throughly on Tae because he’s distracted of Jungkook’s curses. \nSome soldiers were holding back Jungkook now to stop him from punching Hugo further. \nSome were just standing there terrified, cuz they’ve seen Jungkook angry. \nBut not THIS angry.—\nWith too much anger in him, it was the first time that Jungkook’s emotions turned to tears. \nEveryone was so confused, coz never did they ever see their Captain shed a tear or even act weak in front of them. \n“YOU DID THAT TO HIM?!” Jungkook’s voice was more than thunder.—\n“YOU HAD THE FUCKING BALLS TO DO THAT TO HIM?!” The soldiers were holding Jungkook by his arms to stop him from attacking again. \nHugo felt weak at the punches he received. But he didn’t want to be accused on something he did not do. \n“YOU—“ \n“LISTEN TO ME ONCE!”—\nJungkook vision was blurry because of the tears. \n“I DID NOT DO THAT TO HIM! YOU ASKED ME TO SABOTAGE MY FATHER! I SAW HIM THERE IN THE FOREST!” \nHugo cried, being helped on standing up. \n“I did not saw who did it, but it was certainly not me!”— \nJungkook was almost losing his breathe in sobbing, his heart was piercing so much that he couldn’t even think of anything else but Taehyung. \n“S-Sir, please believe...him. He’s telling the truth. I saw him there...he’s not the one who did it.” \nNamjoon was being escorted.—\nHe had a few injury, but he’s weak. \nJungkook was silenced, but his heart was wilding. He hardly shook off all the grips on him and went to the tent were Doctor Hye was. \nHe can barely even walk properly because he’s shaking in so much anger.—\nHye was surprised when Jungkook stormed in the tent, but he’s even surprised that their Captain was crying. \n“T-Tell me he’s fine.” \nJungkook ordered. He wanted to convince himself that Tae will be fine despite of all the blood he’s stained with.—\n“I can’t tell you that,” \nTae was lying on the bed, his wounds being cured and sewed by the nurses and another Doctor. \n“He’s still breathing, but he lost a lot of blood. There’s 50/50 chance that he’ll survive this.” \nJungkook clenched his fist in anger within himself.—\nHe glanced at Tae, who’s sleeping so peacefully, and his eyes were stained with dried tears. \nHow did he manage to save his people, when he can’t even save the person who’s most valuable to him? \n“But he’ll be fine right? He’ll wake up right?”—\nHye realized that maybe, Tae was a very special person to Jungkook, that’s why he’s like this. \nHe went to him and escorted him outside the camp. \n“I suggest you stay here, you’ll be more stressed if you see him.” \n“You’re not answering my question.”—\nHye was silenced. He didn’t know how he’ll tell Jungkook without draining the shit out of him. \n“If you believe in him, he will.” \nHye left, going back in the tent. \nAnd Jungkook fell weak on his knees, running his fingers through his hair.\n—\nHe’s so scared, he’s never been this scared. \nNot because of the war, not even a single fear about the opponents, not even because of death. \nBut its because of the thought that he might loose Taehyung.—\n“I lost my mother, I lost my brother too.” Jungkook started. \nHeaving a shaky breath, tears fell down non stop. \n“God,” He called. \n“Please don’t take away the only person I have.” \nHe placed his hands together, pleading for the above to spare Tae.<br>[ TIME SKIP COZ IM EXCITED ]<br>—\n“Captain!” Sergeant called, running towards Jungkook in his temporary tent. \n“General Reiner is calling for you. He said he’ll kill the President if you don’t show up before the sun rise.” \nJungkook was so lost in thoughts, that he couldn’t even react.—\n“Captain!” Sergeant called, feeling alarmed that Jungkook isn’t even moving a finger. \n“Captain we can’t let them kill the President!” He said, and Jungkook nodded, feeling so drained. \n“Gather everyone, were going to—“ \n“Captain! Taehyung is awake.”—\nJungkook almost fell down his seat as he quickly stood up. \nAn opposite reaction he had earlier.&nbsp; “What?” Jungkook asked. \n“He’s awake now, I think you need to see him.” \nJungkook quickly ditched the two and ran towards the tent where Tae was in.—\nAs soon as Jungkook arrived, he saw that Tae had a lot of bandage, and he just wanted to cry at that sight. \nHe quickly ran to him and hugged him as he was lying down on the.&nbsp; \n“Hyung!” Jungkook cried, holding Tae’s hand so tight like he didn’t want to let him go.—\n“How are you feeling? Were you good now? Does it hurt bad? Who did this to you? Who fucking tried to—“ \nTae held Jungkook’s hand to stop him from speaking. “I’m okay now.” \nJungkook calmed down a bit, he held Tae’s hand beside his cheeks as he kiss it.—\n“I’m sorry, I’m sorry I wasn’t there. I’m sorry I did not do anything to protect y—“ \n“Jungkook, you’re a Captain, bound to serve people and not just your loved one. I understand.” \nJungkook thought he doesn’t deserve him, he’s too understanding. \n“I’ll be fine.”—\nIn the midst of it, Sergeant came in. \n“I’m sorry to meddle in Sir, but we only have a few minutes before the sun rise. We need to get there and save the President.” \nTae felt Jungkook grip tightening on his hand, he knew the younger didn’t want to go and leave him.—\nTae caressed his hand with his thumb. “You have to go.” He said, voice still weak. \nJungkook looked back at him with those teary eyes, and Tae just wanted to laugh at it. \n“Captain,” Tae purposely said. “You have to go.”—\nJungkook sighed, and nodded. Sergeant left, waiting for Jungkook to come out. \nThe younger stood up. “I’ll come back soon, please be well.” \nJungkook leaned forward for a kiss, but this time its not on the forehead, \nIts on the lips.—\nJungkook was so exhausted, so drained. \nAnd Tae was his rest. “I’ll wait for you. Please be well too.” Tae said. \nWith those words, even if Jungkook didn’t want to, he left. \nWithout knowing that its their 2nd to last of seeing each other.\nOk see you guys to the next part!\nAnd guys \nAs always \nMabuhay kayo hangggang gusto nyo!.\n"},{"title":"106","data":"407. \nIn the center of the Capital, there stood a very relevant person in a story. A villain, actually. \nJungkook had finally arrived to the said place, heart still not ready for this, but he had to. \nHe’s a soldier — a Captain.—\nReiner was on the other side of the road, smirking with his soldiers around him. \nAnd Jungkook would never not hate that look of him. \n“There’s no good in starting a war in the first place. Why would you want to own something that’s not yours?”—\nJungkook said, glaring at him. He saw Jaewon beside him, a bandage on his stomach. \nAnd maybe, he knew what really happened to Tae. \nHis fists clenched, and wanted to kill the shit out of that bastard. \nBut he want his death to be more than miserable.—\n“And I ask you, why would you want to stand up till death? You want to be a hero so bad huh?” \nJungkook did not speak, he’s not trying to be a hero. He just wanted justice and peace, isn’t that an enough reason to fight? \n“If you really want to be a hero...”—\nReiner paused, pulling out a paper from his pocket. \n“Then go save your father.” Jungkook frowned at his words, heart beat almost stopping by hearing the word ‘father’. \n“What nonesense are you saying?” Jungkook asked, he wasn’t prepared for this.—\nReiner looked at him, slowly laughing out himself in which Jungkook did not find what’s hilarious. \n“You really did not know your father huh?” He laughed. \n“Shut the fuck up!” Jungkook cried, not knowing why he felt so nervous.—\nReiner fixed his voice and spoke, “How come you did not know...” \nHe threw the cigarette that he was using down the ground then stepped on it to kill the fire on it. \n“...that your father was the President?”—\nJungkook stood there, frozen. \nHe did not want to speak, nor even believe what he’s saying. Because what if he’s just brainwashing him? \n“Shut your filthy mouth!” Jungkook cried, holding up a gun and pointing it at them. \nReiner chuckled, feeling entertained.—\nReiner threw the paper at him, and Jungkook did not even spare the paper a glance. \n“If you believe me, then pick up the paper and find him. If you don’t, okay then. But you’ll never see him alive again.” \nReiner went towards Jaewon and grabbed the hourglass.—\nHe flipped it, and the sand started falling down. \n“You have 10 minutes, if you don’t find him within that time, a bullet will automatically be shot in his head.” \nJungkook felt so pressured, he’s feeling that cold sweat again. \nThe time is running, what should he do now?—\n“Take note, you’re the only one allowed to look for him. If any of your fellows helps you, they’ll be dead.” \nJungkook held tight onto his gun out of pressure. \nBut whatever happens, one of the soldier’s duty is to protect the President. \nSo fuck it.—\nJungkook quickly grabbed the paper below him, and Reiner smirked because he knew Jungkook would do this. \nJungkook frowned at the letters on the paper, but thank God that he has enough knowledge to crack the code. \nWithin just seconds of looking at the paper, he ran away.\nthe code \n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/b300799cdde4141bde376233714755d88b1e4440/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f6f37444b6b30495443575a3749773d3d2d3132382e313661626161363036656531656565323638373136353430353537372e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"1920\" data-original-height=\"1920\" alt=\"the code \">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n409. \nHe didn’t know exactly where the code is referring to, but he trusts his guts.\nArcades. \nJungkook was running so fast since the arcades is much far there. His legs were getting numb, but he had to do his job. \nAfter 5minutes of running, he finally reached the arcades.—\nBut another problem, the arcades is so wide that he didn’t even know where the costume room is. \nHe only had 5 minutes left to look for the costume room, and he thought it’ll be harder. \nHe went around the place, looking for the possible rooms that may have the costume room.—\n3 minutes, the clock is ticking. \nJungkook went to the place were most of the performances are held.&nbsp; \nAnd he was right, there was a costume room there. \nHe looked inside that costume room, rummaged in the closets &amp; everything. \nBut the President wasn’t there.—\n2 minutes left. \nJungkook cursed under his breath, his head was hurting, even his whole body was. \nHe saw another tent, were the circus is held. He did not think twice and ran into there. \nHe’s sure that there’s a costume room here.—\n1 minute, its almost over. \nJungkook finally found the costume room, and finally — he found him. \nHis body was tied onto a pole, a hanky tied on his mouth, and a gun was pointed straight his head. \nThat sounds easy, but a hot wax was dripping onto the President’s skin.—\n“Sir!” Jungkook called, quickly going towards him to untie him. \nBut Jungkook did not get to avoid the dripping hot wax above, so he got one on the back of his hand. \n“Agh! He cried, feeling burnt on the skin. \nBut he needs to gather himself and untie the President.— \n30 seconds. \nJungkook had untied the hanky on his handkerchief. \nAs soon as that, the President let out a heavy pant, sweating at so much fear and pressure. \n25 seconds. \nJungkook was having a hard time on untying the rope because it was too tight and well tied.—\n“T-There’s a glass over there. Break it...” the President’s voice was shaking. \nAnd Jungkook had goosebumps, feeling that he heard that voice before. \nHe quickly grabbed the empty bottle of wine and tossed it on the ground, it shattered. \n20 seconds.—\nHe grabbed a sharp piece quickly, and he was careless since he wounded himself a bit on the sharp. \nBut he didn’t mind it and quickly used it to break the tie. \n15 seconds. \nJungkook successfully undid the tie, and the rope created a mark on the President’s arms.—\n“Sir, we need to get out of here now.” Jungkook said as he held the President’s arm to support him in standing. \n10 seconds. \nJungkook had some other feeling, he knew it wasn’t just a gun, he knew there was something else inside and he can feel it.—\n5 seconds. \nThey’ve gotten out the tent successfully, but Jungkook was still trying to drag the President farther from that place. \nAnd he was right. \nBecause not much far from the tent yet, it was blown away with a huge explosion. \nAnd both were thrown in the ground.—\nJungkook still made sure that he had his back for the President. \nThe circus was on fire. \nAnd Jungkook was surprised when he heard another explosion from afar. \n“They planted lots of bombs here, fuck.” He quickly handled the President to help him stand.—\nThey quicky ran away towards the exit of the arcades as lots of rides were blown up, and the explosive sounds weren’t actually pleasant in the ear. \nThe ferris wheel was the next to explode, and they were actually near it. \nIt slowly fell down.—\nAlmost getting hit, the ferris wheel fell on the ground, creating a huge crack on the ground, and it shattered too. \nJungkook’s heart ached, because that ferris wheel had a special place in his heart. \nIts where Tae and him had their first kiss.—\nThey’ve gotten enough far from the arcades, theyre safer now.\n“Are you okay sir?” Jungkook asked, placing the President before him. \nBut Jungkook was surprised when the President suddenly pulled him into a tight, but warm hug. \nJungkook felt his heart did a slide.—\nJungkook was frozen, and he can hear the sobs of the President. \n“I’m sorry...” he whispered, “Jungkook I’m sorry...” he added. \nJungkook did not want to think about it, but knowing that the President knew his name, maybe Reiner was right.—\n“Are you...perhaps...” Jungkook’s and eyes were tearing up. \n“My father?” He slowly asked. \nThe President slowly unlocked the hug, and Jungkook could clearly see his bruises, his tears and face. \nHe had goosebumps, because he felt like he’s looking into a mirror.—\nThey do look like each other. \nThe President slowly nodded, feeling a bit guilty. \n“Your mother took you both away from me. I searched for you and your brother for years, that I worked myself as the President to make it easier to look for you.”—\nJungkook’s tears fell down his cheeks. \nThe President gently cupped his cheeks, and Jungkook felt something that he haven’t felt for so long. \nA father’s warmth.\nI finally found you. I’m sorry that it has to be on a war. But I’m just really happy to see you finally.”—\n“Youre...my dad?” Jungkook asked, not knowing what to feel. \nAll his life, he longed for a father. He wanted to know how its like to have a father by his side and he grew up not experiencing a father’s love. \nBut now...he found him.\n—\nThe President nodded, “Can I...can I hug you again?” He asked. \nJungkook smiled, tears falling nonstop. “Can I call you dad?” \nAnd with that, they both pulled each other into a hug — a hug that they’ve been wanting to feel for decades. \nFinally.—\nBut the President realized something, he quickly unlocked the hug. \n“We can save this for later, but you really need to get going.” \nJungkook was so confused, his face was so worried. “What’s happening?”—\n“Reiner...the Americans, they’re flying back to the US to send a huge nuclear bomb in Korea. It’ll end us.” \nJungkook was so shocked, and he was loading for a second. \n“We have to stop them, or we’ll be dead. I know they’re starting to fly by now.”—\nJungkook did not think twice and quickly ran away back to the center of the Capital. \nAnd he was almost late, because he saw that they’re already lifting up the helicopter with Reiner and Jaewon above it. \nIs he too late now?\nOk see you guys the next part \nAs always \nMabuhay kayo hanggang gusto nyo!\n"},{"title":"107","data":"408. \nThere’s only one helicopter, and the rest of the soldiers are fighting each other. \nIts a war. \nBut thats not what Jungkook was worrying about. \nBecause the helicopter that Reiner was in, was now flying up the sky. \n“Shit!” Jungkook cursed.—\nJungkook had to think of a way, he can’t just let them go knowing that they’ll be in risk once they finally arrive in America. \nThey were not much far from the center yet, but thats not the point. \nJungkook saw that there was a ladder hanging down the helicopter.—\nBut it needs to require some skills to reach it because its a bit high in the sky now. \nJungkook saw the tank — a military vehicle. It’s just a few meters away from the end of that ladder. \nJungkook did not hesitate to climb it, and jumped up, reaching the end of the ladder.—\nHands almost slipping on the ladder, but he managed to fix his grip. \nHe’s now hanging in the air, and the helicopter was moving up high, maybe they’re not yet aware that Jungkook had reached them. \nHe slowly climbed the ladder.—\nJungkook had finally reached the entrance of the helicopter, and all of them were shocked. \nJaewon was the one controlling the&nbsp; vehicle and Reiner was sitting at the back with Hugo. \nJungkook eyed him, knowing they had a plan.—\nReiner quickly stood up, trying to push Jungkook back down, but the latter had its grip tight. \n“Get off! Or I will not hesitate to kill you on the spot!” \nBut Jungkook had aimed for his arm since its injured. Reiner groaned in pain. \n“Im not a coward like you.”—\nAnd Reiner had enough, he aimed a punch for Jungkook but Captain had quickly dodged it. \nJungkook did not actually expect that he would knee him on his stomach, and that made him almost fall off. \n“General just shoot him already!” Jaewon ordered.—\nReiner did not listen, he wanted to beat the shit out of Jungkook for ruining their whole plan before he shoot him to death. \nJungkook haven’t even recovered yet, but Reiner had flung a fist onto his face. \nEven so, Jaewon keep shouting. “Just shoot him now!”—\nReiner felt so annoyed and offended. “What did you say?” He asked. \n“I said shoot him now! You’re just making shit worse—“ Jaewon haven’t even finished his sentence yet, but Reiner had shot him already. \nA shot on the head was enough for him to cease.—\n“You’ve known too much, you’re not useful now.” \nJaewon flopped on the seat, blood flowing down from him. And he lost total control of the driving. \nThe helicopter was slowly going down, and it was going in zigzags. \nHugo quickly took a hand of the steering wheel.—\nIt was Jungkook’s chance to kick the gun from Reiner and it literally fell down the helicopter. \n“You motherfucker!” They keep exchanging punches, and now theyre trying to push each other down the helicopter. \nIt was hard for Hugo to keep the helicopter going.—\nBecause he was being distracted by the two. \nJungkook was holding Reiner now, ready to push him off the vehicle. But just as soon as he was about to fall, Reiner held onto the side and flipped Jungkook’s grip, \nAnd Jungkook was the one who fell instead.—\nBut he luckily held onto the floor of the helicopter — for now, he’s lucky. \nThey were high up the sky, almost meeting the clouds, but the ride wasn’t that stable because of Hugo’s position. \nReiner smirked, looking down Jungkook.—\n“Sometimes its really nice not to meddle in someone else’s business, Captain Jeon.” \nJungkook glared at him, but he also groaned as he felt Reiner stepping on fingers. \n“Any last words, Captain?” Reiner let out a cocky smile, knowing he won.—\nJungkook was panting for breath, not knowing what might happen next. \nBut he’ll forever be proud of himself for coming this far. \n“Do you know the saying...’the way you cheat, is how you’ll lose’?” \nJungkook asked, &amp; Reiner raised a brow. “What the fuck is that nonesense?”—\nJungkook smirked, ready to let go of his grip, and fall down. \n“Didn’t you send your son to pretend as our ally but he’s actually a spy? Well then, I also sent one to you too.” \nReiner felt nervous, he didn’t want to think of anything else. \n“What?” He asked.—\n“Dad...” Hugo called, voice shaking with tears. \nReiner slowly looked back, not wanting to think what he’s actually thinking. \nAnd as he saw his son with his tears, his heart broke. \n“I’m sorry, but I’m not gonna be as evil as you.”—\nAnd that was Jungkook’s cue to let go of his grip. \nBecause as soon as he drop his hold, Hugo pressed the remote connected to the bomb that he placed inside the hidden part of the helicopter. \nA loud, and huge explosion was heard from above.[ CHANGE POVS FOR PAIN PURPOSES :D ]—\n“NO!” Taehyung shouted, as he witnessed how the helicopter exploded. \nIt would be easy for him tho, but Jungkook was there. \nAs soon as he saw Jungkook earlier hanging on the helicopter, he forced himself to get up, not minding the pain of his stabs.<br>—\nAnd as the helicopter was pierced into pieces, he didn’t want to believe the fact that Jungkook probably did not survive. \nHe’s so tired, so tired more than words. His heart felt so heavy out of crying. \n“I lost Bogum, I can’t loose you too Jungkook, please...” he whispered.—\nEveryone was in surprise, pain and sadness. \nA lot of dead bodies were flopped on the ground, most of the buildings and houses were burned and exploded. \nAnd blood were all over. \nBut now, the mastermind has died, and the war is over. \nBut Captain...their Captain...—\nThe soldiers who made it alive, felt a pang in their hearts as they watch the pieces of the helicopter fly in the air. \nThey saw Jungkook fall before the vehicle exploded, but none of them knew if he made it alive. \nTae’s knees fell on the ground out of weakness.—\nNo words left his mouth as he watch the soldiers take off their hands and bowed down the ground. \n“No...no he can’t be!” Tae cried and he caught their attention. \n“Stand up! He’s not yet dead! We haven’t even seen his body yet!” \nTae held them and helped them stand up.—\n“Taehyung.—“ \n“He’s alive! I know he’s alive—“ \n“Tae stop—“ \n“He’s on his way back! I’m sure he’s alive—“ \n“Taehyung stop it!” Seokjin cried, silencing Tae. \nAnd he didn’t want to say it, but he needs to accept it. \n“Let’s just accept that he’s gone now.”—\nTae shook his head repeatedly, not wanting to agree with what they’re saying. \n“No! You’re lying! He made it! I know he’s alive!” All of them were just staring at him in pity. \nTae stepped forward, “Captain! Jungkook I know you’re alive! Jungkook come out now!” He called.—\n“Captain come on! This isn’t funny—“ \nSeokjin held Tae and hugged him to make him stop, tears falling down his cheeks as he knew how much it hurts for Tae. \n“He’s an angel Tae, he’ll stay in your heart even if he’s gone now.”—\nTae did not move anymore, but he just let himself flop down on Seokjin’s arms as he cry. \nThey knelt onto the ground, as Seokjin was also feeling weak. \n“He said we’ll still meet, he said we’re still going to marry...he can’t be dead....” \nTae cried in a weak voice.—\n“He saved us...he saved the whole country.” \nLieutenant Lee spoke, catching the attention of everyone. Some people also came out, the ones they saved. \n“He did, if not for him, then we won’t be alive anymore.” A citizen spoke.—\nThey started mentioning everything that Jungkook did, and praised him for his bravery. \n“We need to fix ourselves first, then we’ll give him a good funeral.” Lt. Min said. \nTae couldn’t speak anymore, he still doesn’t want to accept that Jungkook is dead.—\nSeokjin unlocked the hug, looking at Tae as he cup his cheeks. \n“Life must go on, okay?” Seokjin tried to cheer him up, but he knew he could never. \n“We have to go now Tae, we need to fix the whole country.” Seokjin offered his hand to help him stand up.—\nBut before Tae could reach for Seokjin’s hand, a soldier shouted. \n“Hey look!” The soldier pointed towards the tall trees, it was like a forest there. \nAll of their faces lit up, as they saw the one and only person they’ve been wanting to thank. \n“Its Captain! He’s alive!”—\nEveryone started cheering and shouting out of joy. \nSome soldiers ran to Jungkook to help him stand up since he’s injured. And some soldiers cheered and thanked him. \nTae couldn’t move, he was just frozen out of happiness. \nHe did it — Tae did the mission successfully.—\nThey lifted up Jungkook, like how those teams in basketballs would do. \nHe had so many wounds, blood stains on his clothes, but because he knew that the pain is finally over for his country, he smiled. \nTae stood up, wanting to run towards his fiancée.—\nBut before he could even take a step, he felt a strong force stopping him on his place. \nThere appeared the fairy, and Tae did not know what to feel. \n“Congratulations, you did it.” She pulled out a sincere smile. \nBut Tae couldn’t get to smile, “What’s happening?”—\n“Why can’t I move?” Tae asked, trying to escape from nothing but air filled with invisible force. \nThe fairy looked at him in the eye, and Tae did not like the sound of it. \n“Ms Fairy please let go of me. I want to hug—“ \n“You have to go back now, Tae.”—\nTae’s heart fell and he heard a silent breaking sound of a glass. He thought he’s hearing things. \n“Come again?” Tae asked. \n“You did your mission, and now, you have to go back to the future.” \nTae let it sink down his mind, and shook his head repeatedly. \n“No!”—\n“I’m not going back! Leave me alone!” Tae shouted and tried to escape an invisible grip. \nBut the fairy just stared at him in pity. “I don’t want to do this Tae, but you have to go back now.” \nTae shook his head, tears falling down his cheeks. \n“You cant do this to me...”—\nThe fairy sighed, “If you don’t go back then—“ \n“—then what?! I’ll mess up the future? I won’t reincarnate? I won’t be born again?” Tae cried, vision blurry out of tears. \n“If that’s it then I don’t care! Its okay if I won’t be born again. But I will never leave Jungkook!”<br>—\nThe fairy knew he’ll say this, and she won’t actually come if thats the only reason. \nBut there’s something more. \n“Okay then, I’ll let you in here.” She paused. \nTae knew it wasn’t just those, she has something more to say.—\n“But if you stay here, Korea will be taken over again. The people will experience slavery for 336 years, &amp; Jungkook...he won’t have a win.” \nTae was silenced. \n“Ur siblings will be in danger, Jennie will be a prostitute, &amp; Yoongi will be killed for something he did not do.”—\n“Korea will never be freed from that colonization. And you will witness its downfall, if you stay.” \nTae was bawling in tears. “No...you’re lying.” He cried. \n“I wish I was, but I finally foresaw everything.” She said.—\nTae’s heart was feeling so heavy, &amp; its even heavier knowing that his decision would involve his owrn motherland, and the ones he love. \n“The time is running Tae, you hav to decide now.” \nTae looked back at Jungkook, who was smiling weakly, but happy to see his people safe.—\n“Now choose, Jungkook...or Korea?” \nTae bit his lip, he did not want to decide. Can’t just stay in between? \nIf he leaves, he knew Jungkook will be hurt. But if he stays, Korea will be in danger. \nHe closed his eyes, he’s finally decided.—\nHe gulped, as he spoke. No backing out now. \n“Korea...” he whispered with his weak voice. And with a heavy heart, he repeated it again. \n“I’ll go back to the future, but please assure me that Jungkook will live his life long.”—\nThe fairy let out a proud smile, he admires how brave and unselfish Tae was. \n“I assure you, he’ll live long.” The fairy raised her hand, gently tapping her wand on Tae’s head. \nAnd slowly, Tae’s existence was vanishing.—\nOut of the blue, Jungkook noticed a familiar presence from far away. \nEven if his wounds hurt, even if he felt so tired, he suddenly became full as he saw the one and only person he’ll love for the rest of his life. \n“Hyung!” He waved his hand, all smiles.—\nBut as soon as he saw that Tae was crying, he finally noticed the glitters around him like a magic thing. He also saw the fairy beside him, and it vanished. \nJungkook realized what was happening. \n“No...no this can’t be.” Jungkook quickly ran towards his direction.—\n“No! Tae no!” He cried, as he exerted all his speed in the run. \nHe stumbled on his feet, because he was still too weak to run. But he quickly got up despite of the pain. \n“No! Hyung you can’t do this!” Tears started flooding his eyes. \nHe ran again.—\nSo close, very close. \nBut just as before Jungkook could finally grab and pull Tae into a hug, \nHe vanished. \nJungkook only hugged nothing, just the cold breeze that he’ll never get used to. \nHe stared at the empty space, feeling so numb.—\nHis knees fell, body shaking with all the emotions he’s feeling. \nHe tightened his hug on himself, wanting to feel Tae in his arms, but its too late now. \nAnd Jungkook couldn’t hold back his tears anymore. \nBecause the person that promised him forever, \nleft him first.\nYan cge mag pakasaya kayo ang hirap mag aral ahh \n😭😭😭😭\nAs always \nMabuhay kayo hanggang gusto nyo!\n"},{"title":"108","data":"409. \nTae sat bolt upright on his bed, not knowing why, but he see a sudden explosion of light that’s why he woke up. \nHis face was tinted with tears, and he doesn’t know its still not stopping. Heart feeling so heavy, did not want to accept it. \n“What just happened...?”—\nHe asked himself as he look around him. \nIt was his bedroom filled with modernized design. He felt like he’s not familiar of things like this before, but nothing even changed. \n“It was a dream...” he whispered ot himself, not actually knowing what to feel.—\nHe sighed and placed a hand on his chest, it felt so heavy. \nHe flinched when the door opened, spitting someone that exactly looks like him. \n“Oh hyung, you’re awake. I was just about to wake you up.” \nIt was his brother — Taerin.—\nThey look identical, very identical that everyone would think they’re twins but they’re not. \nThey have 10 year age gap, and its really crazy that they both look like each other. \nTae was frozen, he felt like its been so long since he saw his brother again.—\n“You have to get up now or we’ll be late for school.” He said. \nTaerin was already wearing his school uniform as a highschool student. \nTae slowly nodded, trying to gather himself together. “O-okay, I’ll get dressed now.” \nAnd with that, the door shut close.\n\n                                <img

\n<br>411. \nTae hopped out of his bed, feeling a bit overwhelmed at the touch of the soft foam, and soft blankets. \nHe went straight to the bathroom inside his room, he’s glad he that he can still remember the modern styles. \nGoing towards the sink, he washed his face.—\nApplying some soap on his hands before rubbing them together, and spreading them in his face. \nHe closed his eyes as he wash his face with water to remove the soap. \nAs he finished, he turned off the faucet and grabbed the towel beside him.—\nHis eyes hurt a bit, maybe because he cried so much. \nHe then remembered that he was stabbed on that dream, having three injuries in total. \nHe quickly looked down as he lift up his shirt to check his abdomen. \nIt was clear, he has no injuries.—\nHe slowly dropped the hem of his shirt to cover back his abdomen. \nHe sighed and laughed to himself saddly, “Maybe its just really a dream.” \nHe wiped his face with the towel to dry it. \nBut as he got a glimpse of himself into the mirror, he saw something.—\nA very familiar necklace was around his neck, it flaunted it beauty as the ray of the sun from the window above hit it. \nTae unconsciously dropped the towel, he’s shocked.\nHis mouth flung onto his mouth, covering it as a tear fell down his cheeks.\nIt was THAT necklace.—\nThat necklace who’ll forever have a place in his heart. Even if its just a simple accessory, it meant a lot to him now. \nBecause it was Jungkook who gave him that. \nSobs came out from his mouth as he couldn’t hold back his tears anymore. \n“Its wasn’t a dream...”\n\n      <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/b8a0cd6ed0248cb2608b56061b60d2c90a74afc0/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f495a5766695962444431596b45773d3d2d3133302e313661643433373339376238396264653836363231323738333937332e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"390\" alt=\"”\">\n  \n    <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n        <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n    </span>\n    <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n      <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n        <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n        <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n      </span>\n    </span>\n   \n  \n413. \nTaerin didn’t know why his hyung is so quiet in the whole ride towards their university. \nUsually, he stays in the passenger seat beside the driver’s. It was their aunt who’s taking care of them now because both their parents were dead. \nHe usually play music out loud.—\nAnd sometimes he sings along with the music. He’s also the one to wake up everyone’s spirits in the morning. \nBut now, Taehyung sat in the passenger’s seat at the back and he’s just quiet as he watch the way they’re passing by. \nTaerin sighed, he just let it slide.—\nThey’ve finally entered their university, splitting ways as highschool &amp; college were on different buildings. \nTaerin had gone to his building, but Tae just stood there, exploring his gaze around the university. \nThis used to be their camping ground in the military.—\nHe saw a familiar face from afar, and he quickly approached her. \n“Good morning Mrs. Min!” He greeted as he bowed. She’s Tae’s history teacher, the one who tasked him for a research paper. \nThe aforementioned was surprised. “Good morning too, Mr. Kim.”—\nShe knew Tae doesn’t usually greet her, because he always avoids her.\nTae was hesitating to speak, but he thought that its probably the reason why he flew back to the past. \n“I don’t have my research paper prepared, but I can tell you what actually happened to Captain Jeon.”—\nTae’s heart ached at the name. \nMrs. Min paused for a bit, and furrowed her brows in confusion. \n“Research paper? What are you talking about?” \nTae’s heart skipped a bit, he felt nervous. “H-Huh? Didn’t you ask me to do a research paper about what happened to Captain Jeon?”—\nTae’s words made Mrs. Min more confused. \n“I’m sorry but I don’t remember asking you about that? And why would I ask you to do a research paper about our national hero? Everyone already knows his story, so I don’t really get what you’re talking about.”—\nTae was frozen on his place, he suddenly couldn’t process well. \n“Everyone knows...what happened to him?” He slowly asked. \nMrs. Min awkwardly laughed and nodded. \n“Of course! You’re acting weird Mr. Kim. I think you should take some rest from studying for a while.”—\nAnd with that, she left. \nTae just stood there, having so much thoughts in his head. \n“I really did change the future...didn’t I?” He told himself. \nHe quickly took out his phone and connected it to the WiFi of their school.—\nHe searched ‘Captain Jeon’ in google. \nAnd as opposite as what happened before, a lot of results showed up. \nHe’s in Wikipedia, quora, and many more verified sites. A lot of description was written and he had some pictures too.—\nHe quickly closed his phone as he felt his heart aching again with the sight of Jungkook. \nTae felt so guilty for leaving him, and he knew that at this time, Jungkook isn’t alive anymore. \nHe walked in the field with his mind flying. There are lots of students around.—\nTae was so lost in thoughts that he was so surprised when hard rubber object hit his head. \n“Aw!” \nHe cried and he fell onto the ground with the sudden thing. It was a soccer ball. \nThe books fell on the ground, and he can feel the slight pain on his head.—\nHe gently massaged that part as he gather his books on the ground. \n“Hey! I’m sorry for that, I think I kicked the ball too hard.” \nA familiar voice spoke, and some hands suddenly helped him fix his books. \nHe looked up, only to see him again.—\nThe guy stood up as he carry Tae’s books. He noticed that Tae was staring, so he flashed a smile, and offered his hand. \n“B-Bogum...?” Tae cried, eyes watering again. \nThe guy furrowed his brows and laughed. \n“Y-Yeah thats my name. How did you know me?”—\nTae remembered the very last time he saw Bogum. \nHe died because of him. \nBut now, he’s here in front of him. Offering him help again, like how he used to do back then. \nHe wanted to hug him, so tight and thank him for everything. \nBut he remembered, \nHe’s in the future.—\nTae slowly got up, realizing everything. He looked down as he wiped his tears.\n“It was written in your shirt.” He excused, and Bogum took a look at his shirt who has his team name, and his own name printed. \n“Oh yeah...wait, are you crying?” He asked.—\nBogum panicked. “Did it hurt that much? I’m sorry I really didn’t mean to! Come on lets get you to the clini—“ \nTae quickly grabbed his books on his hands and shook his head. He flashed a smile. \n“Hey no, its okay. I’m fine, I just had something in my eye.”—\nBogum knew he was lying, but he didn’t want to ask more. He didn’t want him to feel that he’s invading his privacy. \n‘They just met.’ He thought. \n“Okay, again, I’m really sorry.” He apologized. They bowed at each other, and Tae was about to leave. \n“Wait!”—\nTae looked back, confused that’s he’s being called. “Yeah?” \nBogum let out an embarrassed smile as he scratch the back of his head. \n“I would miss on everything if I don’t get to know your name.” \nTae smiled, he’s still the same.—\n“I-I mean, If you’re not comfortable its okay! I’m just asking cuz you look really fun and nice and gorg—I mean wonderful.” \nTae laughed, he missed him so much. But he knew that he isn’t that Bogum he met. \n“Its Taehyung. Kim Taehyung.”<br>—\nBogum smiled, feeling happy that he atleast gave his name. \n“Nice name...see you again?” Bogum said, and Tae nodded. \n“Yeah, see you again.” \nAnd with that, Tae turned back, leaving Bogum smiling. \n“Hey Bogum! What’s taking you so long?”—\nTae paused at the voice, he turned back to see who. \nAnd he felt so overwhelmed when he saw Namjoon, Seokjin and Hoseok wearing the same uniform as Bogum with their names on it. \nHe wanted to run and hug them, but he knew they’ll just think he’s weird.—\nHe turned back, taking his steps away. \n“I hope this time, Namjoon and Seokjin hyung would end up together.” He smiled to himself. \nHe still have 25 minutes before his class starts. So he just went to the cafeteria first to buy some snacks ready.—\n“Oreo mc flurry, one please.” Tae told the server, he’s really glad they have this kind of service here. \n“One caramel macchiato.” He heard a familiar voice from beside him. \nThere are lots of students in the cafeteria, and he didn’t know if he’s just seeing things.—\nThe world literally stopped moving around him, and he can feel his heart beating so loud. \nHe couldn’t even take off his eyes from that person, and he’ll never want to. \nBecause that person, was one of the most valuable being to him. \n“Jimin...?”—\nThe aforementioned looked to his direction, feeling confused. \nTae smiled, and couldn’t help but to burst in tears. \nFinally, his best friend is right in front of him. \nHe quickly ran to him and gave him a tight but warm hug. He doesn’t care if he’s crying out loud.—\nAlmost everyone was looking at them because of Tae’s loud sobs. \nHe’s crying onto Jimin’s shoulders. He missed him, so so much. \n“Minnie I missed you so much!” \nTae cried as he continued to sob on Jimin’s shoulders.—\n“I’m sorry, I’m sorry if I didn’t listen to you. I’m sorry if I had hurt you. I’m sorry for doubting our friendship, I’m really really sorry Minnie. I swear! I’ll make it up to you.” \nHe tightened the hug on Jimin, because only the heaven knows how much he missed him.—\nBut Tae was so surprised when Jimin gently held his shoulders and slowly pushed him away. \nHe saw Jimin’s reaction, he was confused.\n“I’m sorry but...do I know you? I don’t think I’ve seen you before...” \nTae heard his heart shatter.—\nThe server had Jimin’s order ready now, and Jimin grabbed it. \n“Look Mr...uh whoever you are, I don’t know what you’re sorry for. I don’t even know how you knew my name but I don’t really know you. Sorry, I need to get going.” \nAnd with that Jimin walked away.—\nEveryone was now looking at Tae, whispers and whispers around. \n“Sir, here’s your oreo mc flurry.” The server said, and Tae grabbed his order with weak self. \nBecause he couldn’t accept the fact, that his own best friend, \nDoesn’t remember him anymore.\nTangina kuha na kayo ng tissue gago naiiyak bakit? \nBeautiful creatures

\n<br>417. \nIt was already afternoon, this is the time of every students to shine — because class is finally over. \n5 PM, lots of students were heading towards the front gate, some still have classes, but most are now dismissed. \nTae saw a familiar object afar.—\nHe texted his brother to go home first, coz he thought that maybe he’s gonna take time before that. \nHe quickly ran towards that direction, holding back his tears carefully. \nIt was that tree. \nThat tree who stood as their safe place, with the moon &amp; stars as their guard.—\nAs soon as he stepped right in front of that tree, his tears instantly fell, with his knees down the ground. \nThe tree became bigger, had more wrinkles, and it grew more pain into Tae’s heart. \nBecause he knew, that Jungkook had probably waited for him here.—\nHis fists clenched as it laid above his knees, his tear drops meeting the back of his hand. \nIt’s very clear to him. \nHe saw the words him and Jungkook engraved back then. \n‘Taehyung love Jungkook’\nHe didn’t know that his happiest memory, would be the cause of his tears.—\n“I’m sorry...I’m so sorry...” \nTae muttered under his breath as his tears continuously fell.\nHe thought it’ll be easy for him, but who could defeat the feeling of guilt mixed with pain and regret? \nAnd Tae suddenly remembered, \nThe letter.\n\n      <img

it created some noise. \nThey’ve finally arrived in the museum. \nIt was like a fieldtrip, but mostly for education since they’re not highschool students anymore. \n“Woah! This is so beautiful!”— \nA student cried. Three sections of history major were in here. Their school rented the museum for a day so they can focus and have some privacy. \nTae’s silently exploring the museum by his gaze. He felt so nervous coz of overthinking. \nNot long, their discussion started.—\nThe students gathered by section, three teachers were there and they were teaching different sections in the museum. \n“We got the part of our National Hero. And I assure you guys, this is going to be exciting.” \nTae’s heart fell as he heard the word ‘national hero’.—\nBefore it started, the museum staffs explained the do’s and do not’s in the place. \nThey started moving into a room, where most of the things are about Captain. \n“Captain Jeon Jungkook was born in Busan, South Korea in September 1, 1872.”—\n“His mother left them both in the arcades. But he has an older brother who stood as his second parent. But not long after, his brother died in a set-up by General Kim Jaewon.”\nTae gulped, as he saw Jungkooks old photo enlarged in the frame attached on the wall.—\n“So he decided to work himself in the top for revenge. In the midst of everything, the Americans came to colonize us, mentioning General Reiner Cruz. Long story short, he got the justice he wanted, not just for himself, but for the whole country.” \nThe teacher said.—\n“He found out that his father was the President — the late President Jeon Jungkyun.” \nThe students were busy taking photos of the frames on the wall, amazed on the pictures. \nBut Tae was just quiet, because seeing Jungkook in the pictures only, hit so different.—\n“He’s promoted into a General and contributed a lot in the country. He’s the youngest General to ever exist in history. He’s actually offered to be a President, but he refused because he said he wanted to be free from the duties just once from his life.”—\n“And you know what? He lived really long! He died at the age of 117, and he’s one of the longest Korean who lived in history.”\nThe information was new for the students. \n“Sir! I have a question, did he have a lot of girlfriends? I mean, he looks really handsome.”—\n“And you know what? He lived really long! He died at the age of 117, and he’s one of the longest Korean who lived in history.”\nThe information was new for the students. \n“Sir! I have a question, did he have a lot of girlfriends? I mean, he looks really handsome.”—\nEveryone laughed at the student, counting the professor. \nAnd Tae, he didn’t want to hear the answer because what if Jungkook replaced him? What if Jungkook found someone better than him? \nThat would hurt a lot. \n“Well, actually...there’s a rumor about Jungkook.”—\nTae was ready to cover his ears because he’s really afraid. \nBut just before he could, their professor spoke. \n“He only fell for one, and never did ever looked for someone else.” \nThe students felt touched and sad about that, and Tae felt like crying.—\n“Look at this painting.” Their professor showed them a painting. \nIn the painting, there was a man in silhouette standing under the tree. \n“This is a painting of one of our best painters in Korea. He said that Jungkook always goes under that tree in our school every night.”—\n“No one knows why he goes here every night. Even before he died, he went to that tree like he’s waiting for someone.” \nTae felt like all of his energy was drained, he’s in so much pain that he can’t feel anything anymore. \n“And here, this painting...”—\nThey moved to another painting on the side. \nIt was a painting where a man was sitting in front of another painting. And the painting in the picture, seems too familiar for Tae to not realize.—\n“This is the visual representation of Jungkook before he died. His butler said he always visits this painting and kept drawing the same person on papers everytime.” \nTae’s hand flung onto his mouth in shock.\n“That day, he died in front of this painting.”—\n“And there was a letter found in his pocket. That letter proved that Jungkook was waiting for one person all his life that went away.” \nThe students were in awe, “He’s so loyal. I hope he’s still alive.” She cried. \n“Wait sir, what letter are you exactly talking about?”\n[ FLASHBACK FROM THE PAST ]<br>—\n“Jungkook?” \nLisa called, seeing him under that tree again. \nJungkook looked to his direction, stopping from strumming his guitar. “I know I’ll find you here.” \nLisa sat beside him. “I still don’t know why you’re always here.”—\nJungkook did not pay attention to her, and just started strumming again, like he’s memorizing a song. \nLisa noticed his silence, she sighed. “Are you still waiting for him?” \nJungkook still did not answer. And Lisa knew the answer already.—\n“Jungkook, its been 25 years since everything happened. You always go here, and yet he’s not coming. You’re not getting any younger, you have to move on now, find some—“ \n“If you’re not gonna say anything good, then leave me alone.” Jungkook felt the tears in his eyes.—\nLisa sighed, wrinkles traced on her skin now. She’s getting old — both of them are getting old. \nShe stood up, “I don’t want to say this, but he’s far gone now. Its much impossible for you both to mee— \n“Shut your fucking mouth!” Jungkook cried.—\nThe moon’s light met Jungkook’s face, and Lisa saw how his eyes glistened with tears. \n“He’s gonna come okay? He promised me! He said we’ll meet here! I promised him that I’ll wait for him whatever happens, I know he’ll come soon.” \nA tear fell down his eye.—\nLisa had now words, there’s nothing new about Jungkook. He became more aloof and lost control of his temper when Tae went gone. \nShe left, not wanting to add more fuel in the fire. \nJungkook closed his eyes, and clenched his fists.—\nHe let out a shaky breath. \nIts been so long since he shed a tear. He thought its his last time of crying when Tae disappeared. \nHe lost a huge part of himself. \n“Taehyung... you promised me right?” \nHis voice cracked in tears. “You promised me hyung...”&nbsp; [ 60 YEARS LATER ]\nTangina bakit ako.naiiyak 😭<br>— \n“Sir, Its time for you to go home.” \nJungkook was again standing under that tree with the light of the moon. But now, he’s holding onto his cane because he’s having troubles on standing now. \nHe’s 85 years old, and yet he’s still waiting for him.— \nHis butler came to him and assisted him, but Jungkook refused. \n“No, please give me a little more time. He’s coming, I know he will, he promised me.” \nThe butler felt so much pity on Jungkook, even though he didn’t know who he’s talking about.—\n“Sir, you’ve been saying that for the past few hours and its already 1 in the morning. You need some rest sir.” \nThe butler did not let him refuse anymore because its his job to take care of him. \n“No..no, I need wait and see him here. I know he’s coming..!”—\nJungkook pleaded, but he couldn’t resist anymore. \nBecause he’s old now, and his strength is not enough. \nAll he can do is cry, because its the only thing that could help him with his feelings. \n“Hyung...where are you...?” He cried.[ 80 YEARS LATER ]—\n“Sir we need to take your medicines now.” \n“N-no...later. I need to visit hyung f-first.” \nJungkook is now 117 years old, and he’s now having troubles in speaking. \nThe butler guided him towards that room, where a painting is attached on the wall.—\n“I’ll just give you some minutes sir, okay? Then after, we need to drink your medicines.”\nJungkook smiled weakly as he sat on the chair in front of the painting. “O-Okay.” \nThe butler left to give Jungkook some privacy.—\nAnd even after years, even if he’s now old by age, his eyes still haven’t changed. \nThey still have sparkles whenever he look at Taehyung — even in just a painting. \nHe can still remember what happened back then, its very clear. \n“I...miss you so...much.”—\nJungkook let out a shaky breath. \n“I-Its been 80 years hyung...I’m still waiting f-for you.” Jungkook cried. \nA tear fell down his cheeks. “But you n-never came.” \nHe let out small sobs as an image of Taehyung flash in his mind. \n“I’m kind of...tired now h-hyung...”—\nJungkook could feel his heart changing is heart beat. \n“W-Why did you leave...me?” He asked, even though he knows that the painting would never answer. \n“I h-hate you hyung...y-you did not fulfill your promise...” \nIts been years, and yet the pain is still there.—\n“But why can’t I hate y-you? Why am I not angry a-at you...?” \nHe said in between his sobs. “I still love you Taehyung...its still you.” \nJungkook couldn’t speak well out of tears, but he wanted to let out his feelings cuz he couldn’t take it anymore.—\n“Do you mind i-if I take a little nap?” \nJungkook cried, looking straight into the painting. Its been so many years, and yet he still cannot get enough of Tae’s beauty. \n“It’ll be q-quick. And I hope that once I wake, y-youre here now.”—\n“I-I promise...it’ll be quick.” \nWith that, even before Jungkook could close his eyes fully, he saw the ray of the sun beautifully shining at him. \nHe smiled, knowing what might happened. \nHe closed his eyes, and maybe, he has already accepted it.—\nMinutes after, his butler came in. \n“Sir, we have to take your meds now.” He said and came to him. \nBut Jungkook was still. “Sir, we have to go.” He said, and looked at Jungkook. \nHe’s alseep. \n“Sir? Wake up now, we have to take your meds first.”—\nBut Jungkook still did not budge. \n“Sir?” The butler shook him a little, and he felt nervous. \nHe kept on calling and calling him, trying to wake him up, but he did nothing, not even a budge. \nHe quickly checked his pulse, and the bulter knew it.—\nHe felt so sad, because Jungkook became like a second father to him. He’s been taking care of him since years. \nHe grabbed his radio on his pocket, he was a soldier too. \n“Hello? This is Nurse Hanbin. Its about General Jungkook...he’s...he’s gone now.”—\n“Please send some soldiers over to carry him. Thanks.” \nHanbin dropped the call by the radio, he can feel the tears in his eyes. He didn’t even get to thank Jungkook for everything that he’s done for him. \n“You lived long sir, I know you’re tired. I hope you’re happy now.”—\nHe saw that Jungkook was holding that handkerchief on his chest. \nIts been years of seeing that handkerchief, and Jungkook had it with him always. He wanted to ask why he’s carrying that hanky everytime, but he didn’t get a chance. \nHanbin saw a paper in Jungkook’s pocket.—\nHe furrowed his brows, curious about that nicely folded paper inside his pocket. \nHe slowly grabbed it, and opened it carefully. \nHe read the whole letter, even though he know its not for him. \nBut that name in the letter caught his attention. \n“Taehyung? Who’s Taehyung?”&nbsp; [ END OF FLASHBACK ]\nmy ghad \nMabuhay kayo hanggang gusto nyo!\n"},{"title":"111","data":"423. \nTae had no words about that story that their professor told them.\nHis lips were almost bleeding because he kept biting them to hold back himself from crying. \nBut he failed, cuz tears are already falling down.\nJungkook waited for him...he fulfilled his promise.—\n“In the world war, Reiner asked his soldiers to kill every historian alive in Korea. But they didn’t know that Jungkook was once a historian himself. That’s why he’s the one who listed everything that happened back then.” \nThe students didn’t know what to feel anymore.—\n“The letter that was found in his pocket, I’ll leave it to your research guys.” \nThe students groaned and complained, they were really curious about the letter. \n“Jungkook actually composed a song for his lover, and thats what I’m showing you guys today.”—\nTae was frozen in his spot. \nHe suddenly remembered that time when he asked Jungkook to make him a song. \nAnd he’s scared that...what if its that song? Is he ready to hear his voice again? \n“What’s the title sir?” \n“Still With You. Listen to it carefully okay?”—\nTae wanted to run, he wanted to ditch his class and just disappear in the blue. \nHe know he’s not yet ready, he know he’ll just hurt himself again. \nBut he couldn’t move any of his part as soon as the music started playing. \nIt echoed through the 4 corners of the room.\n(Btw this is actually a video but i cant save it so i just screenahot so you guys can see it

his sobs, his knees fell down the ground as he knelt. He was shaking in tears.—\nOne of his classmates noticed him, and quickly went to him to check if he’s okay. \n“Taehyung-ssi, what’s happening? Are you okay?” He then started drawing attention. \n“Mr. Kim? Are you okay?” One of the teachers approached them.—\nTae nodded quickly and stood up. \n“I-I’m sorry I’m not feeling well.” Without any hesitation, Tae turned around and quickly ran away. \nPeople kept calling him, but he did not turn to see them again. \nHe just wanted everything to end now.[ TIME SKIP COZ IM EXCITED ]\n\n      <img

</span>\n   \n  \n<br>[ 5 YEARS LATER ]— \n“So basically, if you don’t know history, then you know nothing at all.” \nThe 29 year old Taehyung, has finally became a history teacher. After graduating from his school, he immediately started teaching. \nHe chose to teach in his school.—\nNot only just because he wanted to return the favor from his teachers, but he didn’t want to leave that tree. \nHe’s been teaching in college for a year now, and he’s enjoying it. \nIt was really hard for him to manage his time in working as an attorney and being a teacher.—\nBut just as soon as he knew that he saved up for himself and his family enough, he quitted being in law and chose teaching. \nHe’s happy, he knew its happy. But everything that happened 5 years ago, will forever be marked in his heart. \n“Sir! I have a question!”—\n“Yes? What is it?” Tae asked, fixing his eyeglass. \n“Sir, Mina has a a crush on you!” The students teased and started making noises. All that Tae can do, was smile. \n“She wanted to ask you have a girlfriend, if none, can It be her?” The students laughed.—\nThey kept teasing that girl who really does look beautiful, but unfortunately, Tae’s gay. \nTae shook his head. “Hey, stop it now. You’re making her uncomfortable.” Tae cried. \nSome stopped, and some still kept teasing the girl. \n“But I’m not in a relationship.”—\nThe cheers and teases became louder because of that. \n“But I have a fiancée.” Everyone was shut down, surprised at what they just heard. \n“Fiancée? But sir, you said you’re not in relationship.” \nTae smiled, and heaved a sigh.—\n“Yes, but I almost got married. Unfortunately, my fiancé was born in 1872, and I was born in 1995. So he’s basically dead.” \nThe students frowned at his words. “1872? I don’t get it.” \nTae laughed, “You won’t believe me even if I explain.” \nThe bell rang, “Class dismissed.”—\nThe students left the room, and Tae was actually going back to the faculty room when his co-teacher approached him. \n“Taehyung-ssi! I was looking for you.” She cried. \n“Oh, Ms. Han, what is it?” He asked as he closed the door.—\n“The head of our school asked me to take care of our new transfer teacher today. But I have an important meeting now and I can’t ditch it. So is it okay if I ask you do that task instead?” \nShe asked, and Tae did not hesitate to nod. “Of course!”—\nShe handed him a folder where the information of the new teacher was in. \n“He’s actually here now, I asked him to meet you in your office. I’m really sorry for the inconvenience but I really need to go now. Good luck!” \nMs. Han waved goodbye and went away.—\nTae fixed the folder in his hand as he take his way towards his office. \nHe entered the room and placed the folder on the table, he’s quite nervous because its his first time assisting a transfer teacher. But he thought it’ll be fine. \nA knock on the door was heard.—\nTae quickly sat on his chair, and spoke. “Come in,” he thought that it might be that transfer teacher. \nTae accidentally nudged the pen holder and it fell down under the desk. “Oh, oops!” He leaned down to reach for it. \n“Goodmorning Mr. Kim.” He heard a voice.—\nTae grabbed the pen holder and placed it back above the table. \n“Yes goodmorning, sorry for that, haha.” He said, and opened the folder in front of him. \n“So I suspect that you’re the new teacher right?” He asked as hw review the papers. \n“Yes, thats me.”—\n“Welcome to our school! I hope you enjoy your stay here!” \nTae was still not looking at him, he’s busy checking the information paper. \nBut just as soon as he saw that 1x1 picture attached in the paper, his whole world stopped. \n“Thank you sir, its really nice here.”—\nTae rubbed his eyes to try and fix his vision. He thought he was just seeing things. \nBut as he look at the picture again, he felt chills in his whole body. \n“Uh...Mr. Kim? Are you okay?” \nHe didn’t want to look up, he knew he wasn’t ready yet.—\nTae held onto the handles of his chair. \n“Sir you look pale, do you want me to get you some water?” \nThat voice...how come that he did not recognize that voice. Its been 5 years already, and yet everything still felt fresh to him. \nEven if he’s scared, Tae looked up.—\n5 years had passed since he last saw that face again —that face whom he hated at first, not knowing that it will be a big part of his life. \nSame eyes, same lips, same nose, same figure and features. Tae couldn’t almost believe it. \nA tear fell down his eye. \n“Jungkook...?”\nTangina gago jungkook daw taehyung kaya mo yan wag ka hihimatayin baka nagpaparamdam hahah kaloka char \nMabuhay kayo hanggang gusto nyo!\n"},{"title":"112","data":"429. \nTae stood up from the chair, trying to make sure that he’s not just seeing things. \nThe younger was quite confused at his reaction, “Uh..yes sir. That’s my name.” He said. \nBut he realized one thing. \nJungkook laughed a bit. “You thought I was Captain Jeon, right?”—\nTae was frozen, he couldn’t even blink an eye. \nJungkook scratched the back of his head, he knew the answer. \n“Don’t worry, I’m not him.” He joked. \n“People say I do look like him alot, and we have the same name. Its crazy.” He laughed.—\n“But we don’t have the same surname.” He smiled. \nTae was almost falling down the ground with his knees. He doesn’t know but that smile...its been so long since he’s seen it and its making him weak.\n“O-Oh...” Tae quickly wiped his tears.—\nHe thought that Jungkook probably thought he’s a freak. \nHe sat back onto his chair, shaking. If Captain reincarnated, Tae knew he won’t remember any. \nBut if this isn’t the reincarnation of Captain...then Tae doesn’t know what the fuck was the universe’s reason.—\n“My name is Jungkook, but its not ‘Jeon Jungkook’, it’s ‘Han Jungkook’.” The younger explained. \nTae nodded, and held the papers back in his shaky hands. “Y-Yeah, I’m sorry for that.” \nTae talked to him about things, and guided him in everything.—\nAs years pass by, they became friends too. \nJungkook was a PE Teacher, and Tae was a history teacher. They enjoy each other’s company, and soon, they became best friends. \nTae thought he finally knew what the universe wanted to do.\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/ca87b0a3de498ab33567b4192a86af9df607c636/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f784a775f746b4956493636776c413d3d2d3133342e313661643437653435313861376434383838393632323133363733392e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"750\" data-original-height=\"548\" alt=\"Tae thought he finally knew what the universe wanted to do\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n431. \nLater on, Tae found out that Jungkook was bisexual. \nAnd you know, as both of them are actually slowly forming feelings for each other, they decided to try out things. \nThey officially went in a relationship together.—\nThey did just as what couples would do — cuddles, dates, flattering words, monthsaries, anniversaries, and everything. \nThey were happy, really. \nThey’ve been in a relationship for 3 years now, and its really going well.—\nBut as they say, secrets can ruin a relationship. And communication is really important. \nBut none of them cheated, none of them lost time for each other.

\n<br>436. \nYears and years passed, they fulfilled their promise to each other that they’ll still be bestfriends after the breakup. \nAnd they’re happier as best friends, Tae was promoted into a master teacher, and Jungkook decided to quit teaching to be a chef.—\nFast forward on Jungkook’s wedding — he’s finally getting married. \nTae was his best man, he’s his best friend after all. And Tae knew he had finally moved on. \nHe’s happy for Jungkook, because he finally found the person whom he’ll spend his life with.—\nTae smiled, he had finally accepted his fate. \nHe had fully lost hope that he’ll find another Captain Jeon in this life. He didn’t want to wait for another one again, because he knew that his heart only belongs to Captain. \nMaybe, its time for him to move forward.—\nRight now, Taehyung was getting ready for sleep. He’s now 45, still unmarried, and he didn’t want to get married anymore if the groom isn’t Captain. \nHis brother was staying in his house with his wife who’s 9 months pregnant, almost giving birth.—\nHe let them stay in his house first, because Taerin had just built a house for him &amp; his wife. So for the mean time while its not yet finished, theyre staying here. \nTheir aunt is staying here too, because Tae is all alone in this house, and she thought that he’ll be lonely.—\nTae changed onto his pajamas, he turned off the lamp light, and was ready to lay on his bed when a shower of glittery light appeared in front of him. \nHe was surprised, felt a bit of fear and was ready to fight. \nBut then he recognized those sparkles.—\nThere appeared a person he’s never seen in the past years. \n“Ms. Fairy?” He cried, eyes bawling in surprise. \nThe woman smiled at him, she’s still the same fairy from back then. And it doesn’t look like she aged. \n“Taehyung! Oh god, its been years!”—\nThey excitedly hugged each other, both of them were overwhelmed. \n“I thought I’ll never see you again!” Tae cried, feeling so happy to see the fairy again. \n“Well me too, but I forgot to tell you something.” She laughed and scratched the back of her head.—\n“What is it?” Tae asked, sitting back down on the bed. \n“You have one wish left.” She said while holding her wand. \nTae furrowed his brows in confusion. \n“One wish left? But I never made a wish right now?”—\nThe fairy was actually expecting this. \n“Well, that moment you wished to go back in the past, you already made your first wish. I found you that time, and its like...I became your genie.” \nTae looked at her, not being able to process it. \n“What was my...second wish?”—\nThe fairy was hesitating to speak, because she knew that Tae was quite sensitive about this. \n“You wished for Jungkook to live long and stay with you, right? Do you remember that night?” She asked gently. \nAnd Tae felt an ache in his heart. \n“Yes.”—\n“That was your second wish. Captain lived a hundred years and more, and he stayed with you by heart.” She sighed and smiled. \nTears were again forming on Tae’s eyes. He thought he’ll never cry about that again, but he’s wrong. \n“And its now time for your last wish.”—\nTae quickly wiped his tears before it fell. “Why are you telling this to me just now?!”\n“I’m sorry okay?! I have a lot of jobs and I totally forgot about your last wish. That’s why I’m here to finally finish everything.” \nTae sighed, he felt troubled.—\n“Tae, I know you’re still thinking about him. And I want you to think about your wish very carefully. I don’t want you regret anything again.” \nTae thought she was right. He needs to think of this carefully. \n“Do I really need to make a wish now? As in right now?”—\nThe fairy nodded as she played with her hair. “Of course! Duh, I can’t wait forever.” \nTae bit his lip, “Can you atleast give me 5 minutes?” He asked. \nThe fairy thought of it, and maybe she can give him some time. \n“Sure, just 5 minutes okay!”—\nOut of silence, Tae could hear the clock ticking. \nHe was very focused on thinking about his last wish, and finally, he had decided. \n“I know my wish now.” He said. \n“That fast? It has just been 30 seconds? But okay.”—\nThe fairy waved her wand in the air, and it created trails of glittery lights like magic. \n“Are you ready Tae?” \nTae heaved a sigh, and he knew he had to be ready. \n“I am.” \nThe fairy smiled. “In the count of three, state your wish, okay?”—\nTae was nervous, hands feeling so cold. \n“1...” \n“2...” \n“3...” \nAnd that night, Tae had finally made his last wish. And its the wish he’s been wanting all his life.\n[ THE NEXT DAY ]<br>—\nTaerin barged in Taehyung’s room, holding a trumpet. He blew it and it created a loud noise, he did that in purpose to wake up his brother. \n“Happy Birthday to the most stubborn person in the world!” \nHe cried and laughed.—\nHis wife — Chaeyoung came in, wearing a birthday hat, and holding her rounded belly. \n“Happy birthday Taehyung-ssi! Wake up now!” She cried. She treated Tae like her own brother too. \nTheir aunt came in, holding a birthday cake. “Taehyung-ssi! Wake up, its ur birthday!”—\n“Hyung! Come on! Wake up now or I’ll throw you some cold water.” Taerin hopped onto the bed and shook his brother to wake him up. \nBut Tae was just still, eyes closed. \n“Taehyung-ssi! We prepared a cake for you!” Their aunt said. \nBut Taehyung, still no response.—\n“Taehyung-ssi, wake up!” Chaeyoung gently patted him on the shoulder. \n“Oh you want some tickles huh?” Taerin cried, and quickly ran his fingers onto Tae’s side to tickle him because he usually reacts quick to this. \nBut they’re quite alarmed when Tae did not even budge.—\n“Taehyung?” Their aunt shook him to wake him up. \n“Taehyung-ssi, its not funny.” Chaeyoung cried, not amused if ever Tae was joking around. \n“Hyung stop it, wake up.” Taerin said, a bit pissed. \nTheir aunt checked his pulse, and she cried.—\n“Auntie...why are you crying...?” Chaeyoung asked, gently holding the woman. \n“His...his pulse...its not beating anymore.” She cried, holding tight onto Tae’s hand. \nTaerin stood there frozen, he didn’t want to believe her. \nHe shook his brother. “Hyung! Wake up!”—\nUntil the room was full of crying, they still couldn’t believe that Tae was probably gone. \nSuddenly, out of nowhere, Chaeyoung felt pain right on her stomach. \nShe thought it was just a random pain, but as seconds went by, the pain was growing more.—\nShe held onto her belly, trying to ease the pain. But its just getting stronger. \n“H-Honey...” Chaeyoung called, and she caught the two’s attention. \n“Chae? W-What’s going on? Are you okay?” Taerim panicked, going quickly towards his wife with tears on his eyes.—\nUntil Chaeyoung couldn’t hold back the pain anymore. \n“Aaagh!” She cried, tears forming in her eyes in pain. Their auntie panicked too, and maybe she knew what was happening. \n“Chae, your waters broke! You’re giving birth!”—\nTaerim panicked. “I’ll ready the car okay!” He quickly ran in the speed of light. \nThe car was finally ready, and Chae was crying in pain, she’s in the car now. \nThey got Tae in the car too, they still need to bring him into the hospital for assurance.—\nBut little did they know, that Tae’s wish was just starting. \n“My last wish, is for me and Captain’s story to repeat again — but this time, a happy ending will count.”<br>437. \nAfter an hour of waiting, the doctors had finally let Taerin in the room. \nCheeks still stained with tears, he felt so happy when he saw Chae lovingly looking at their newborn. \nTaerin leaned forward, giving his wife a kiss. \n“Honey, he looks like you.” Chae said.—\nTaerin felt he heart jump when he saw his son for the first time after 9 months. \nBut his emotions were a mess right now, because despite of having another addition in the family, they lost one too. \n“How’s your brother?” Chae asked. \nTaerin sighed. “He’s gone.”—\nChae felt sad too, they did not even get to thank him for assisting her and her husband. \nTaerin was an engineer, and Chae was an interior designer. Taehyung helped the both of them graduate and start with their life as a married couple.—\n“Actually...I dreamt of Taehyung-ssi last night. He told me something about a necklace.” Chae said. \nTaerin furrowed his brows in confusion. “Necklace?” \n“I don’t actually understand but he told me to name our son after him, and give our son the necklace in his cabinet.”—\nTaerin thought a little, he’s suddenly remembering that necklace that Tae always refuse to take off. \n“I think I know that necklace.” He said. \n“I named our son Taehyung, not just because of my dream, but also as a thanks to him for helping the both of us.”—\nChae carefully gave Taerin the baby who’s wrapped in a blue towel. \nTheir little one looks angelic. “We lost hyung, but they gave us our son. I think, that’s fair enough.”\nTaerin smiled, lovingly gazing at his son. \n“Taehyung — Kim Taehyung — Welcome to the world, my love.”<br>[ 7 YEARS LATER ]<br>—\n“Just hold on a second baby, I’ll just call dad. Okay?” \nChae told her 7 year old son — Taehyung — who’s patiently playing with his airplane toy. \nThey’re currently in school — that same school where Taerin graduated.—\nThere are lots of people — not only students, but also parents and some other family members. \nThere’s a competition going on — writing contests, poster making, collage making and etc.\nSince Taerin graduated here, he’s chosen as the speaker for the quiz bee competition.—\nChae was busy talking on the phone, but she’s still keeping her eyes on her son.\nTae was quietly playing with his toy when he heard cries from far beside him. \nThe kid got curious. He looked behind him, only to see a little boy crying under that tree. \nIt was THAT tree.—\nAt first, he was just staring, silently judging the kid. \nBut you know, he’s in the age of exploring things. He slowly walked towards that boy, who’s crouching on the ground as he cry. \nIt wasn’t much far from his mom, so he’s fine. \n“Why are you crying?” He softly asked.—\nThe little boy looked up, tears falling down his eyes. “Go away! My mommy told me not to talk to strangers!” \nTae pouted, but he thought of an idea. “My name is Kim Taehyung.” \nThe little boy frowned at him. \n“I’m not a stranger anymore. So you can talk to me now.”—\nThe little boy thought he had a point. But he still refused to answer. \n“I’m not a bad person.” Tae pouted, really wanting to befriend the little boy. \nThe boy sniffed on his snots. “R-Really?” \nTae nodded with his boxy smile. “Whats your name?”—\nThe little boy was still hesitating, but he still spoke. \n“M-My name is Jeon Jungkook.”\nThe boy said in between his sobs. Tae knelt a little to be fair to his height. \nThey’re ages are 2 years apart. \n“Why are you crying Gukkie?” Tae asked.—\n“I can’t find my mommy.” He let out a loud sob, and tears fell down his cheeks again. \n“You mea, you’re lost?” Tae asked, and Jungkook nodded. \n“I was j-just looking at toys but when I looked b-back, I can’t find my mommy a-anymore.”—\nTae held the younger’s hand, and gently pulled him up to stand. \n“Come on Gukkie, I’ll save you.” Tae said, acting all tough as he remember all the cartoons he watched. \n“S-Save me?” Jungkook asked, eyes hurting in tears. \n“Yes! We’ll find your mommy.”—\nTae was holding Jungkook’s hand tight, really taking responsibility of him being the older. \nThey went to Tae’s mom. And just at that moment, Chae ended a call. \n“Mommy! We need to help him.” Tae cried, begging for his mom. \nChae was surprised to see another kid.—\nShe knelt down onto their height. “Hello little guy! What’s your name?” Chae asked. \nJungkook was still sobbing. “M-My name is J-Jungkook.” \n“Mommy he’s lost! We need to help him.” Tae cried. \nChae saw how tight their hands were on each others. She thought its cute.—\n“Oh, is that so?” Chae stood up and held his son’s hand. \n“Let’s go to the guard. We’ll ask him to give you a shout out so your mommy will find you easier. Okay?” She smiled, and gently patted the boy’s head. \n“See Gukkie? We’ll find your mommy soon!” \n“O-Okay.”—\nAs they finally reached the guard, Chae asked him to give the kid a shout out for his mother to find him. \nThey were just waiting for the mother to come. \nThe two kids were sitting on the bench as they wait. \nJungkook was surprised when Tae tickled him.—\n“Hey! Why did you tickle me?” Jungkook laughed a bit. \n“Cuz you’re not smiling. Don’t be sad, your mommy’s gonna come soon!” Tae tickled him again. \n“H-Hey! Stop!” Jungkook giggled. \nUntil the two were having fun tickling each other and laughing together.—\nJungkook noticed the odd pendant of the necklace that was on Tae’s neck. \n“What is that?” The boy asked, looking straight at the pendant. \n“Oh, this?” Tae held the pendant on his smol palm. \n“Mommy said, this is from my uncle.”—\n“Where’s your uncle?” Jungkook asked. \n“They said he’s an angel now.” Tae sadly said. He felt a bit sad not even meeting his uncle. \n“Oh...that’s okay. He’s an angel.” Jungkook said, but he’s still curious. \n“Why is the pendant like that?”—\nTae did the pendant sign on his hand, lifting all his index, pinky and thumb. He’s still having troubles on maintaining it since his hands are still smol. \n“Its like this!” Tae showed Jungkook, and the younger imitated it. \n“Like this?” Jungkook showed him, and Tae nodded.—\n“My dad said it means ‘i love you’. Because it’s three.” Tae explained. \nJungkook looked at his hand, and tapped the lifted fingers as he say the word. \n“I! Love! You!”\n“I love you!” \nThe both of them playfully shouted.—\n“I love you!” \nJungkook pointed his hands onto Tae. \nThe older giggled and pointed his hands onto Jungkook too. \n“I love you too!” \nAnd you know, one of the most beautiful things in the world, was a child’s innocence.—\n“Oh, Jungkook-ah, I think that’s your mommy.” Chae called and pointed at the woman running towards them. \nJungkook paused a little, and his cute doe eyes bawled when he saw his mother. \n“Mommy!” \nHe hopped down the bench and ran to his mom.<br>—\nThe lady had tears in her eyes, and she quickly scooped the little boy in her arms as she tightly hug him. \n“I’m sorry baby, I’m so careless. I thought I’ll loose you forever!” She cried as she gave Jungkook soft kisses. \nChae and Tae stood there, watching them happily.—\nThe woman noticed the both of them. \n“Are you the ones who found my son?” She asked. Even before Chae could speak, she’s surprised that the woman knelt down infront of her. \n“Thank you so, so much for you kindness!” She cried. \nChae helped her stand up.—\n“No ma’am, its okay! It was actually my son who found him.”\nThe woman smiled towards Tae. “Thank you so much, little guy.” She said. \nTae bowed in 90 degrees, almost loosing his balance. \n“Thank you!” \n“No baby, you ‘say you’re welcome’.” \n“Oh oops, you’re welcome!”—\nAll of them were endeared at that cute moment. \nJungkook ran towards Tae and gave him a hug. “Thank you hyungie!” \nTae hugged back. “Don’t forget me, Gukkie!” He said as they broke the hug. \n“I won’t,” Jungkook showed him the ‘i-love-you’ sign. “I’ll remember this.”—\nWith that, even though they don’t want to part, they knew they have too. \nBut the little kids doesn’t understand why they felt something when they saw each other. \nNot knowing, that the repeat of their lovestory, \nis now starting.<br>[ 15 YEARS LATER ]\nGago nakakaiyak penge ng tissue mare 😭 tangina nakakapg mura ako ng wala sa oras\nSee you to the last part 😭\n"},{"title":"113","data":"[ 15 YEARS LATER ]438. \nJimin let out a loud sob as tears fell down his eyes. \nIt was on that same university, and they’re college students. Tae and Jimin are both up on the rooftop to have some privacy. \n“Oh come on! He’s not a loss! He sucks!” Tae cried, cheering up his best friend.—\nJimin was almost choking on his cries, he wiped his tears. \n“You think I’m crying over that guy? No! I’m crying over giving him my first kiss! I thought he’s the right one but he failed me.” Jimin cried. \nTae sighed, he doesn’t actually know what to say.—\nBecause he’s never been in a relationship— maybe just flings? Or puppy loves? But a serious relationship with real love? He’s never experienced that. \nEven though sometimes Jimin &amp; him fight, he still hated seeing his own best friend crying.\nHe snatched Jimin’s phone.—\n“Hey! What the hell?!” Jimin cried. \n“What are you doing?! Give me back my phone!” \nJimin was trying to reach for his phone on Tae’s hand, but Tae was taller than him. \n“No! I’ll make sure to leak his photos you showed me! That’s what he’ll get from hurting you!”—\nJimin’s eyes bawled. “Are you crazy?! He’ll know its me—Give it back!” \nTae was raising the phone as he try to type. He logged in onto his anonymous account and sent the video of Jimin’s ex-bf to their school files.\nTae knew it’ll ruin that guy’s image but he deserves it.—\nJimin got on a bench to reach the phone from Tae’s hand. \nBut it was too late for him because Tae had already ran and made his way towards the stairs down the rooftop. \n“Kim Taehyung!” \nJimin shouted as he ran after him.—\nTae was down on the 4th floor, meeting some students. \nHe keep saying ‘excuse-me’s’ as he try not to bump into students. He was giggling as he run because he knew Jimin was after him. \nAs he run, he tried to type the context to send it to their school files account.—\nLuckily, he looked up, and saw that Jimin was on the other side of the hallway that he’s taking. \nHe laughed in surprised and quickly took turns, going back to where he came from. \nThe floor was a but slippery, but he can manage it.—\nHe took the other stairs down to the 3rd floor on the left side of the hallway because Jimin was on the right. \nHe’s almost stumbling on the stairs as he tried to avoid the students he ran onto. \nA lot were looking at him because of his running.— \nJust as soon as he got down the stairs, Jimin was almost near. \nHe was so surprised that he made a huge flinch. His laughter echoed through the hallway. \nTae quickly took turns and went on the left side instead, meeting their President Council.—\n“Kim Taehyung, no running!” Lisa cried, watching Tae ran continuously. \nShe rolled her eyes in annoyance. “Gosh, that brat.” She said and left.\nBut before she could, she also saw Jimin running in the hallway. \n“Park Jimin, stop right there!” She cried.—\nJimin tried to stop on running by his feet, &amp; he did, but he slipped as the floor was slippery &amp; his speed was too much. \nHis butt hit the floor. “Ouch!” Jimin cried &amp;stood up. “Isn’t it the ‘no running in hallways’ a policy here now?” \nJimin scratched the back of his head.—\n“I’m sorry President, my bestfriend is just—“ Jimin reasoned out. \n“You’re a peace officer, okay? Do your job or I will charge you with this.” Lisa said, and Jimin nodded. \nAfter Lisa left, Jimin stomped his feet in annoyance. \n“Gosh! I even got scolded!”—\nWhile Taehyung kept running with the thought that Jimin was still after him. \nAs he ran, he tried to look back for him, somehow unable to control his speed. \n“Is he still after m—AH!” \nTae cried as he bumped onto someone, and they fell down the ground.—\nThe impact was really hard. Tae’s eyes was shut tight with the fear of hitting the ground. \nBut instead, he just felt arms around him and he heard a loud groan. \nThey slid on the floor with the impact, and everyone was looking at them.—\nAs the slide stopped, Tae was holding his breath, and he slowly opened his eyes. \nOn to realize that he was on top of a person, that’s why he didn’t hit the ground. \nHe saw the person’s face, and he really is in pain. \n“Ouch! That hurts.” He groaned.—\nTae panicked as he saw the guy’s elbows, and its somehow bruises. \nHe quickly got up and helped the guy get up too. \n“Oh no I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean to! I-I wasn’t looking on my way, I’m really sorry!” Tae cried, almost tearing up in nervousness.—\nThe guy stood up, and brushes his fingers through his hair as it was covering his eyes. \nHe felt the pain on his elbow. “Its okay, I wasn’t looking on my way too.” He apologized. \nTae felt so guilty as he look at the guys wound, its bleeding.<br>—\n“Its bleeding! Come on, let’s take you to the clinic!” Tae held his wrist. \n“Hey no! Its okay, I can handle this.” He said with a sincere smile. But Tae insisted. \n“Please, I really feel guilty. Just let me take you to the clinic, okay?”—\nThe guy couldn’t resist anymore, he just let Tae take him towards the clinic. \nAnd he thought that Tae’s grip on his wrist was really cute, he’s really worried and guilty. \nAs the arrive there, the nurse immediately aided the guy’s wound.—\nAnd Tae just stood on the waiting area inside the clinic, holding tight onto his phone. \nHe’s really nervous, maybe he was being a bit careless. He bit his lip to stop himself from tearing up, he’s like a baby. \n“Hey,” the guy called, and Tae flinched in surprise.—\n“O-Oh, are you okay now? Did the nurse say something? Do I have to pay for some—“ \nTae was cut when the guy giggled a bit. There’s now a band-aid like on his elbow. \n“Don’t panic, I’m totally fine. Its just a wound, not a stab.” He said.—\nTae gulped, he bowed down in 90 degrees. “I’m really sorry for what happened, I didn’t mean to do that and It was really my fault for not looking into—“ \nAs Tae say his apology speech, the guy noticed the necklace that was hanging down on Tae’s neck while he’s bowing.—\nHis eyes narrowed, trying to know if he’s seeing it right. \n“I’m sorry to ask but...where did you get that necklace?” \nThe guy hesitantly asked, not wanting to make Tae uncomfortable. \nTae was taken a back, “O-Oh, this necklace?” He held the pendant on his hand.—\n“This isn’t actually mine. My parents gave this to me when I was still young. B-But they said that its from my late uncle.” \nTae explained, holding tight onto the pendant. \n“W-Why do you ask?” He’s still nervous.—\nJungkook shook his head and smiled. “Nothing, I just remembered someone from that necklace.” \nTae’s brows frowned. “You mean to say, you’ve seen someone with this necklace before?”\nJungkook nodded, “Yeah, but that’s a long time ago. You just probably have the same necklace.”—\nTae looked at him suspicious, grip getting tight on the pendant. \n“Are you serious? But as far as I know, only my family have this kind of necklace. So how come?” \nThe guy also got confused. “I don’t know? But I really saw that be—“ \nThe guy paused. “Wait a second,”—\nThe guy looked at Tae like he’s inspecting him. \n“Are you perhaps...Kim Taehyung?” The guy asked, feeling nervous too. \nTae’s brow cocked, feeling surprised. “How did you know my name?” \nThe guy face literally lit up as he smiled when Tae said that.—\n“Hyung its me! Its me Jungkook! Jeon Jungkook!” The guy cried, eyes smiling also. \nTae frowned, the name seems familiar to him. “D-Do I know you?” Tae asked. \nThe guy bit his lip, trying to find a way for Tae to remember him. \nAnd an idea hit him.—\nThe guy showed him the same exact sign that he’s never ever forgotten. \nThe ‘i-love-you’ sign. \nTae’s eyes bawled, hand covering his mouth in surprised. \n“Wait, you’re really Jungkook?!” Tae cried as he look at the guy in front of him.—\nBecause as far as he can remember, the Jungkook he saw back then was cute, eyes so round and it has stars in his pupils. His voice is so tiny and Tae was taller than him back then. \nBut now, the Jungkook he’s seeing is all grown up, and he’s somehow taller than Tae now.—\n“Yes! You thought me this sign right? When I was lost?” Jungkook cried. \nTae ran to him for a hug. Both felt so happy because they thought they won’t see each other again. \n“Oh my, its been so long! You look different!” Tae laughed.—\n“Yeah, you too.” Jungkook said. \nThey were still talking for awhile, not being able to find each other’s childhood friend. \nUntil someone came inside the clinic. \n“Oh, Captain! They told me you’re here. What happened?”—\nTae felt scared, because he’s the reason why Jungkook is in the clinic. \n“Just a little wound, but I’m okay.” He told the guy wearing a jersey uniform. \n“Oh, this is Taehyungie-hyung, my friend. Hyung, this is Yoongi-hyung, my teammate.”—\nThey bowed to each other. “You’re a Captain?” Tae asked. \nYoongi nodded, running an arm around Jungkook, as he act proud. \n“Yes! He’s a basketball Captain. He’s really good, you know? Do you want to see our practice—aw!”\nJungkook laughed as he pinched Yoongi’s ears.<br>—\n“Don’t say that, he might be uncomfortable.” \nTae shook his head and smiled. “No! Its fine, and is it really okay to see you guys practicing?” Tae asked. \nAnd Yoongi nodded quickly, “Of course! Why don’t you cheer for him?”—\nJungkook pulled him onto the side where Tae couldn’t hear the both of them. \n“What are you doing? You’re exposing me!” Jungkook cried. \n“What? I’m helping you with him. Isn’t he your friend with that necklace you told me? You said you have a crush on—“ \n“Shh!”—\nThe three got out from the clinic, but as they open the door, they saw Jimin in the front. \nHis expressions changed when he saw Taehyung. “There you are you motherfucker—AH!” \nJimin stepped on a spilled water and almost slipped, but luckily, Yoongi held his hand.—\nYoongi being Yoongi, he winked at Jimin. \nJimin quickly got up and shook his hands off him. “Thanks.” He said without even looking at him, still traumatized at guys like those because he just came in a breakup. \n“Am I gonna see you later?” Jungkook asked Tae.—\nTae smiled and nodded. “I think so. My next classes are on the afternoon so I’ll have a lot of time today. See you?” \nJungkook couldn’t help but to smile. “Okay then, see you.” \nYoongi and Jungkook left, but Jimin heard what Yoongi said. \n“That other guy is so rude!”—\n“I heard that bitch!” Jimin shouted back and tucked his tongue out at Yoongi who’s rolling his eyes at him. \n“Looks like you got yourself another man huh?” Tae teased, and Jimin smacked him on the arm. \n“I’m gonna kill you! I got scolded because of you!”—\nIt was full of laughter, and Tae didn’t know why his heart was beating so fast. \nThat moment when they fell together, an image suddenly popped in his mind like a flashback but its very vague. \nNot knowing that it was actually their past.<br>[ AFTER A YEAR ]\n\n      <img

\n<br>443. \n“Woah! I missed the arcades!” \nTae cried, opening his arms wide as he feel the cold breeze brush on his skin. \nIts now 7 in the evening, and Jungkook brought Tae to the arcades for their date tonight.—\nEven though they’ve been in dates before, but for Jungkook, this time is different. \nIts been so long since they first found each other, and he admit that he had a little crush on Tae. \nBut as they spend their time together, Jungkook realized that maybe, \nhe’s inlove.—\nAnd with that, he asked his best friend — Yoongi for some advice. \nHe’s planning on confessing to Tae tonight. \nHe’s afraid to get rejected, but its now or never.\n“Let’s go on the carousel first!” Tae cried as he happily pointed at the carousel afar.—\nJungkook laughed a bit, “I thought you’re gonna choose some grown up rides.” \nTae pouted, “It can be for grown ups too!” He held Jungkook’s wirst and dragged him towards the carousel. \nThere are lots of people, mostly kids. But Tae doesn’t care, he wanna have fun.—\nIt was their turn on the line to ride the carousel. \nThere are some adults inside too, but its because they’re guiding their kids. \nTae thought of pranking Jungkook. \nSo he let the younger ride first, and as soon as the gate was closing, Jungkook realized it.—\nHe was already riding a horse, and his eyes bawled. “What the—hyung?!” \nTae was laughing so hard, while Jungkook was pouting as he felt so betrayed. \nHe rode the whole ride with the frown in his face. \nBut as he saw Tae laughing, he didn’t know but he found it funny too.—\nTae took a step back from the carousel, taking his phone out as he open the camera. \n“Jungkook! Say cheese!” \nTae cried as he capture him who’s giving him a glare.\nHe set the photo as his wallpaper, he thought it’ll make him laugh in the morning.—\nThey rode a lot of rides, dragging here and there, laughing together as they enjoy the games. \nIts already 9 in the evening, and they didn’t even notice. \n“One last ride, and we’ll eat.” \nJungkook cried, feeling overwhelmed with happiness.—\nTae bit his lip as he look around. \nFull of colorful lights, and people were around, and the first that caught Tae’s attention was the ferris wheel. \nTae pointed at it, a bit hesitating. \n“There! I wanna try the ferris wheel.”—\nJungkook hesitated a bit, its not that he didn’t want the ride, but he knew that Tae has fear of heights. \n“Okay, let’s go!” He cried and they both went towards the ferris wheel. \nThey paid for their ticket and fell in line as they wait for their turn.—\nTae was looking up at the ferris wheel as he fidget with his fingers. \nJungkook knew he’s anxious. \n“Are you nervous? We can take another ride if you don’t wan—“ \n“No, its okay. I can manage this. I just really wanna try riding the ferris wheel.” Tae smiled.—\nTae was surprised when Jungkook grabbed his hand and held it. \nTae’s hand were cold and a bit shaky, and Jungkook’s was warm and calm. \nIt felt very comforting to Tae. \n“Look at me, just me.” \nJungkook said and Tae didn’t know what to feel about that.—\nIt was finally their turn to ride the ferris wheel. \nTae was feeling a bit nervous, he’s a bit shaky but he’s glad that Jungkook was there with him. \nThe ferris wheel started going up, and Tae flinched. \n“Ho shit.” He held on Jungkook’s sleeves in fear.—\nJungkook laughed, he thought its cute. “What’s funny, huh?!” Tae cried, eyes shut tight. \nThe windows were wide, and Jungkook can clearly see the beauty of the land from beyond them. \n“It’s not that scary hyung,” Jungkook cried. \n“Its actually beautiful.”—\nBut Tae still kept his eyes shut. He can feel the ferris wheel going further up, and his legs were shaking. \nJungkook tickled Tae, and the elder flinched. “Hey! What are you doing?” Tae laughed. \n“If you don’t open your eyes, I’ll keep tickling you.”—\nTheir cell was full of laughters, and Tae couldn’t take more. \n“Okayokay! Stop it!” Tae laughed. “I’m gonna open my eyes now so stop it!” \nJungkook laughed, his mission is successful. \nTae really did open his eyes — but only one, the other is still shut.—\n“Hey! Open both!” Jungkook tickled him again. \n“Wait a second! I’m a bit scared.” Tae laughed, closing both his eyes again. \n“Don’t be. I’m here, I won’t let anything bad happen.” Jungkook said. \nTae can feel his heart beating so fast, he might go crazy soon.—\nTae slowly opened his eyes, hands holding tight onto Jungkook’s hand as he still felt so scared. \nHis eyes landed on the window, “Woah-woah!” He cried as he saw how high they are now. \n“Calm down, just breathe in and out. You can do this.” Jungkook encouraged.<br>—\nTae did as he was told, and as he open his eyes again, he what Jungkook was talking about. \nHe can clearly see how beautiful everything was, and it was so calming. “Wow...” \nThey’re both busy looking at the view around, &amp; Jungkook didn’t realize that Tae was looking at him.—\nHe saw how his eyes shine as the light hit it. He really believe that Jungkook holds the whole universe in his eyes. \nAnd that smile, that pure smile, Tae can never get enough of it. \nJungkook was surprised when Tae gave him a peck on the cheek. But Tae was more surprised.—\nTae panicked. \n“I-I’m sorry, I didn’t mean that! It was really a habit for me to do that when I’m too happy a-and you’re really cute today I-I mean your smile is—“ \nJungkook cut Tae — not by words too — but by his lips.—\nTae paused in his moment of shock, not being able to sink everything in his head. \nBut as seconds passed, Tae felt himself kissing back. And both were lost on the kiss. \nTae flung his arms around Jungkook’s neck as he felt the younger’s hand on his waist to deepen the kiss.—\nTheir hearts were jumping in euphoria. And they can feel butterflies wilding in their stomachs. \nTheyve been wanting to feel this kind of sensation for years, they wanted to feel real love. \nAnd maybe they found it now.—\nAn image suddenly flashed on Jungkook’s head, but it was very fast and vague. \nThey broke the kiss, foreheads against each other as they gasp for breath. \n“I have to tell you something.” Jungkook said in a low voice.—\n“I like you hyung, I don’t know since when, and how it happened. But I found myself falling deeper for you as time pass by.” \nTae didn’t know what to feel. \n“I’m gonna court you,” Tae was taken aback by his words. \n“I will court you whether you like it or not.”—\nJungkook felt so nervous, but he finally said it. \nAnd didn’t know what to feel when he heard Tae laughed a bit. \n“You’re so funny!” Tae cried as he smack Jungkook’s chest. \nJungkook’s heart broke. “I’m not joking!”—\n“I know you’re not! But its just funny,” Tae laughed. \nJungkook didn’t know what’s funny.\n“I mean, who told you I’m not gonna let you court me?” Tae laughed. \nA smile quickly formed Jungkook’s face. \n“I like you too idiot, but you have to court me first.”—\nJungkook felt like crying, he can’t believe that this is actually happening. \nWithout any hesitation, Jungkook pulled Tae close again, and their lips met. \nThe history is repeating itself, but the universe made sure that this time, \nthey’re for each other.\n"},{"title":"114","data":"444. \n“Is that Yoongi hyung and Jimin hyung?” \nJungkook asked, narrowing his eye as he look into one straight direction. \nTaehyung and him were on their way to the library for a mini study, and they suddenly saw those two familiar figures. \n“Yes, its them!” Tae cried.—\nThey both went towards them, and Tae laughed when he realized what was happening. \nBoth Yoongi and Jimin were standing outside their classroom, they’re in a ‘T’ pose with books above their head and both hands. \n“Are you guys being punished?”—\nJimin’s face looks so annoyed. “You saw nothing.” He said. \nTae &amp; Kook laughed. “What did you guys do again?” Jungkook asked. \nJimin sighed.\n“This jerk placed a frog in my bag! I got surprised and spilled my water in Mrs. Cha’s papers!”\n“I told u its not me!” Yoongi said.—\n“I’m certain its you! You were laughing so hard when I got surprised!” \n“It’s because u look funny! That doesn’t make me the culprit!” \n“Shut up! You can’t change my mind!” \nTae and Jungkook were laughing as they watch the two bicker again.—\nSuddenly, the Vice President of school council passed by and heard their bicker. \n“You two! Can you stop fighting for once? If you don’t, Yoongi I’ll report you to your coach. And you Jimin, you might loose your position in the school council.” \nJennie scolded.—\nThe two were shut, but they’re still giving each other deadly glares. \nTae and Jungkook decided to leave, because theyre just gonna waste their time if they watch them. \nThey both went into the library, were a lot of students were in.—\nThey got their seat, and Tae grabbed some books first in the shelves. \nAs Tae was done, Jungkook was the next one to grab his books for his exam in culinary arts. \nIts really amazing that Jungkook can maintain his good grades while he’s in the varsity team.—\nHe went back to their seat, where he found Tae opening a book and writing notes in his notebook. \nTae looks a bit tired, and Jungkook had noticed it. Their exams are near, and its probably harder for Tae because he’s a law student. \nJungkook thought of something.—\nHe remembered that thing that he wanted to give Tae. \nHe grabbed something from his bag, and placed it above the book that Tae was reading to catch his attention. \nTae’s eyes sparkles as he saw it, he lifted his head and excitedly smiled. \n“Strawberries?”—\nJungkook nodded. “Yeah, I heard that’s your comfort fruit. I saw that in the groceries and the first thing that I thought of you.” \nTae felt touched at how thoughtful he is. \n“You’re really doing your best on courting me, huh?” \nJungkook laughed. “Of course!”—\nTae bit his lip, feeling nervous. “Well, I actually have something to tell you about that. And I think you have to know now.” \nJungkook felt both curiosity and nervousness. “Yes? What is it?” \nJungkook leaned forward, making sure that Tae would be comfortable to tell him.—\n“Actually...” Tae started, fidgeting on his fingers. He doesn’t know if he’s doing this right. \n“I have a boyfriend now.” \nJungkook’s heart literally stopped in a second. He was frozen on his seat, and he can feel his heart being peirced. \nBut he still kept his smile.—\n“We just started dating today, and I really do think you should know that.” \nJungkook doesn’t know what to feel and react. “O-oh...really?” \nTae slowly nodded. \n“Wow...congrats hyung!” Jungkook leaned back on his seat, feeling a lump in his throat.—\n“You must’ve really love him, huh?” Jungkook smiled, but Tae knew how much he’s hurting inside. \n“Yeah, I love him and I know he loves me too. I’m very lucky to have him.” \nJungkook can feel some tears on the side of his eyes, but he managed to hold it.—\n“How’s he like?” Jungkook asked, looking down at the books to distract himself. \n“I mean...Is he good? Is he studying here? Do you know him well? Are you sure he won’t hurt you?” \nTae laughed. “Don’t worry, I trust him.”—\n“Do you wanna know his name?” Tae asked. \nJungkook smiled and shook his head. “No its okay, that’s your privacy and I know that I have no rights to—“ \n“His name is Jeon Jungkook.” Tae smiled. \nJungkook nodded. “Oh wow, nice name. He must be—wait a second.”—\nJungkook looked at him, with that unbelievable look in his face. \nHe looks so surprised, those puppy eyes got bigger and a smile was slowly forming in his face. \n“Hyung...are you kidding me?” He asked. \nTae laughed. “Of course not. He’s my boyfriend.”—\nJungkook had slowly sank it in his mind. \n“So...we’re official now?” Jungkook asked, unable to hold back his smile. \nTae nodded with that beautiful smile in his face. “Well, as you said...we’re official now.” \nJungkook couldn’t hold back the excitement in him.—\n“YES! YES! FINALLY!” \nJungkook jumped from his seat as he shouted. Tae was laughing as he try to make the younger sit down because a lot of students are looking at them. \n“You over there! First warning!” \nThey heard the librarian said, and Jungkook immediately sat down.—\n“Sorry ma’am.” Jungkook said. \nBut even if he’s sitting down already, he still shouted in happiness but in a whisper tone. \nTae laughed at him, he thought it was cute. \nJungkook held Tae’s hand, and kissed his knuckles. \n“I assure you, you won’t regret this.”<br>[ 4 YEARS LATER ]—\nThe ‘I like yous’ turned to ‘i love yous’ until after years, Jungkook has finally decided to do it. \nEveryone around them was squealing, and cameras were towards them. \nTheyre in Jungkook’s own restaurant, and the younger prepared something special for Tae.—\nJungkook knelt down before him, and Tae flung his hand onto his mouth covering it, he was in full shock. \nHe thought Jungkook just invited him in his restaurant because its their anniversary today. But he didnt know that it’ll be like this.—\nJungkook grabbed a small red box in his pocket. He presented it to Tae, and opened it in front of him. \nAs soon as Tae saw the beautiful ring, an image flashed in his mind. But he couldn’t recognize what was it coz its too vague. \nBut it was THAT ring.—\n“Kim Taehyung, I’m not gonna make this any longer. I prepared a speech for you but I forgot it out od nervousness. Maybe I’ll just send it to you later.” \nThe people inside the restaurant laughed.\n“But...will you do the honor of marrying me?”—\nEveryone was waiting for Tae’s answer, hearts beating too fast and feeling awe in what they’re witnessing. \nTae repeatedly nodded. “Yes! Yes, of course!” A smile formed Jungkook’s face as he heard that. \nHe stood up, and placed the ring on Tae’s ring finger.—\nJungkook placed a quick kiss on Tae’s lip — its just quick one because he’s afraid he might want to kiss him longer. \nHe instead placed a kiss on Tae’s forehead. Bot felt their hearts overwhelmed. \nThe crowd cheered and clapped.[ 7 MONTHS LATER ]—\nAs soon as they got proclaimed as a wedded couple, they both gave all their time for work so that they can fully enjoy their honeymoon\nAnd they’re now in Paris, its the one they chose to spend the honeymoon in. \n“Gukkie, should we visit that fashion show tomorrow?”—\nThey’re in a hotel, and its currently night time. \nJungkook felt his heart jumped, he slowly turned towards Tae who was sitting on the couch, looking at a magazine. \n“What did you just call me?” Jungkook asked. \nTae looked back at him, feeling confused. “Its Gukkie...why?”—\nJungkook’s eyes were shaky, he doesn’t know why he’s feeling that over a damn nickname. \n“Hey babe, are you okay?” Tae asked as he noticed Jungkook’s behavior. \nJungkook laughed and grabbed his towel. \n“Y-Yeah, I’m just gonna shower.”—\nBut Tae couldn’t hold back his laugh as soon as he caught a glimpse of Jungkook’s bottoms — there was something pent in there. \nHe shook his head as he laugh. “Did he really got turned on by the nickname?” \nUntil Tae heard a random song in the television.—\n“Loving can hurt...loving can hurt sometimes~...” \nTae frowned, because he felt like he’s heard this song before but he couldn’t remember. \n“And its the only thing, that I know~” \nTae held onto his chest, it suddenly felt heavy.—\n“We keep this love in a photograph—“ \nTae quickly turned off the television. He didn’t even realize that he was crying. \n“Why am I crying?” Tae asked as he wipe his tears. He doesn’t know why his heart felt so heavy on that song.—\nNot long after, Jungkook came out of the bath, drying his hair with the towel. \nTae was still on the couch, and Jungkook sat far from him. The elder noticed. “Why are you sitting away from me?” \nJungkook felt a bit shy. “Im afraid I might do something if I come close.”—\nTae laughed, he thought Jungkook was cute. \nHe went towards him, slowly. Jungkook felt his heart beating, and butterflies were wilding inside his stomach. \nBut he felt a bit disappointed when Tae turned to the side and went on the fridge instead.—\nJungkook looked back at him in confusion. He can see Tae drinking water, and purposely acting sexy. \nJungkook clicked his tongue. “Kim Taehyung,” \nTae flinched when Jungkook called him by his full name. \n“Are you trying to seduce me?”—\nTae couldn’t move in his place. Well, he actually is teasing him but he thought its his dead end. \n“Of course not! Why? Are you seduced?” Tae scoffed back. \nJungkook stood up and slowly walked towards him, placing both his arms beside him to lock him. \n“And If I am?”—\nTae closed the gap between them and aimed for his lips. \nIt was a moment of kissing, when Jungkook lifted him up, without breaking the kiss. \nHis feet lead him to the bedroom, and he gently placed Tae there, trailing kisses on his neck.<br>—\n“Mmh..” Tae cried and he was so lost in the sensation that he did not even realize that his husband was laughing. \nTae felt disappointed in the loss of pleasure. “Why did you stop?” \nJungkook placed a kiss on his nose. “I was just playing around too,” he giggled.—\nBut Jungkook was taken aback then Tae kissed him again. \nThey broke the kiss, leaning their foreheads against each other. “Jungkook...” he called. \n“Hmm?” \n“Make love to me.” \nJungkook froze as he heard those words.—\nHe quickly sat on the bed and held Tae’s hand. He didn’t want him to misunderstand his actions.\n“Baby, I’m sorry If what I did made you pressured. I mean, i would love too but I’m nor forcing you. We’re still young, we have a lot of time. Okay?” \nHe kissed his knuckles.—\n“I’m not pressured. I’ve been really thinking of this even before our honeymoon. And hey, we’re now married, I trust you.” \nTae smiled, feeling touched at how sweet and thoughtful his husband was. \n“Are you sure about this?” Jungkook asked.—\nTae nodded, and Jungkook did not try to hold himself anymore. \nHe took off his top, and threw it onto wherever the fuck it went. \nHe flashed playful smile on Tae. \n“No backing out now.” \nAnd that night, was just a night full of love.—\nIn some other parts of the galaxy, there was one universe where they already met. \nWithout knowing, that this already happened, that the tears they shed before was worth it, that their strings of fate were once tied to each other, \nAnd that they’ve been loving, \nsince 1894. \n— [ THE END ]\nOmg its finally done guys i already done it for you i hope you loved the story os SINCE 1894 theres a lot of twist and shocking events and thank you so much for the love and support for this book 114&nbsp; parts guys i really hope you guys enjoyed the story i hope you have a tissue😭 until next time \n\"Since 1894\" Captain Jeon is officially signing off 💗\nVideo you can wath in youtube Also about \"Since 1894\" captain Jeon \n\n  <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n    <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n      <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n      <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  <iframe data-video-id=\"GO7f6QXjzBo\" width=\"764\" height=\"330\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GO7f6QXjzBo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" id=\"widget2\" class=\"initialized\" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1_19=\"true\"></iframe>\n\nThank you for all the love and support until next time \n&nbsp; -Your Author\n"},{"title":"In My Opinion","data":"So guys wag kayong umasa na may silbi tong part na toh kasi mag sussulat pa rin ako ng book2 pero di na mahalaga yun kasi natatakot pa rin ako kasi alam nyo na 😇 well i just want to share smth and idk if you guys are interested but thats ok cause trip ko lang toh 🙂\nHi its me again and again i know am a little bit brat lol but i just to want share that i already finished reading the book set of 'I love You Since 1892' the author is Binibining Mia a young filipina writter. Its about 2 years since 'Captain Jeon/ Since 1894' was published and written by ARTSEOULVK in twitter and idk whats shes doing right now. By reading this 2 stories i found out that they have a similarities to each other. I cant deny the fact that am still shocked about the flow of the story of ilys 1892 even tho i already read Cap Jeon l/ Since 1894. I was a little bit shocked by all of the scenes in the 2 stories. I can say that Since 1894 is 45% similar to ilys 1892. Why? Because if you read the 2 stories you will notice the difference between them although the flow of the story is similar but we cant deny the fact that some scenes in Since 1894 are unique. First ilys 1892 was original written by Filipino and Captain Jeon is written in english. Second as we all know captain jeon is 'captain' means soldier while Juanito is a medical student (tapos kasama nya si Ca tapang 😭). Third Cap Jeon is BL book and ilys 1892 was not. Lastly i find the 2 stories interesting why? Because both of them stole my heart i cried so much reading them. To be honest i dont want to post this because you know by this the issue might open again but yeah here i am writting this lol. Well i can understand the side of fans of Bb. mia (and jikook shippers ) but i think we should look at the bright side of our life and besides this is only a story and Captain Jeon is not published in physical book. But if someone is interested to comment about this kindly dm me so we can talk more private. And if someone tells me that this is a 'crime' or plagiarism even tho am not the orig author pls dm me so i can unpublish the story right away. And if Bb. Mia did not say anything about this ill keep this cause why not? And ill let you all know yes you guys can repost translate this because in the end of the day am still not to orig author soo i dont have the rights to take the opportunity to you so if you have plans then go :) but pls give a credits to ARTSEOULVK and Bb. Mia to avoid issues :).\nAng dami ko nanamang sinsabi cge bye \nMaraming Salamat<br>Gracias<br>감사 해요\nNag papasalamat <br>Yesha 💗 <br>\n💔💔💔<br>❗❗❗\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/49f2cc24435a04e185eac6350add8ea63c353eb9/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f436f50487867316b625679377a773d3d2d313139353930323839312e313665333530643738623261663064383435353439353639343339342e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"719\" data-original-height=\"973\" alt=\"Di mo na kailangan i report kasi ramdam ko na nasa panganib na account ko 😊 (pls send help)\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \nDi mo na kailangan i report kasi ramdam ko na nasa panganib na account ko 😊 (pls send help)\n\n                                <img src=\"https://img.wattpad.com/9bc69dd3ed91ed2b407f2039ef1f3a590b082510/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f4c5942754174627534556a6858513d3d2d313139353930323839312e313665333530653939333262633064633732303630373932343930382e6a7067?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720\" data-original-width=\"708\" data-original-height=\"1060\" alt=\"Di mo na kailangan i report kasi ramdam ko na nasa panganib na account ko 😊 (pls send help)\">\n                            \n                              <span class=\"banned-overlay hidden\">\n                                  <span class=\"banned-messaging hide\"></span>\n                              </span>\n                              <span contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"on-remove-image\">\n                                <span class=\"play fa-stack fa-lg\">\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-circle-filled fa-wp-neutral-1 fa-stack-2x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:autopx;\"></span>\n                                  <span class=\"fa fa-remove fa-wp-neutral-5 fa-stack-1x \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"></span>\n                                </span>\n                              </span>\n                             \n                            \n Yes i thought its already done but i guess am wrong lmao 🤗\n(Ok guys bawal daw yung same ideas , plot, scenes 💔)\nPlagiarism can cause me trouble 🙃 \nBa't ganun cap jeon lang ba same sa ibang stories?
